'Wither away and die:' U.S. Pacific Northwest heat wave bakes wheat, fruit crops

CHICAGO, July 12 (Reuters) - An unprecedented heat wave and ongoing drought in the U.S. Pacific Northwest is damaging white wheat coveted by Asian buyers and forcing fruit farm workers to harvest in the middle of the night to salvage crops and avoid deadly heat.

The extreme weather is another blow to farmers who have struggled with labor shortages and higher transportation costs during the pandemic and may further fuel global food inflation.

Cordell Kress, who farms in southeastern Idaho, expects his winter white wheat to produce about half as many bushels per acre as it does in a normal year when he begins to harvest next week, and he has already destroyed some of his withered canola and safflower oilseed crops.

The Pacific Northwest is the only part of the United States that grows soft white wheat used to make sponge cakes and noodles, and farmers were hoping to capitalize on high grain prices. Other countries including Australia and Canada grow white wheat, but the U.S. variety is especially prized by Asian buyers.

"The general mood among farmers in my area is as dire as I've ever seen it," Kress said. "Something about a drought like this just wears on you. You see your blood, sweat and tears just slowly wither away and die."

U.S. exports of white wheat in the marketing year that ended May 31 reached a 40-year high of 265 million bushels, driven by unprecedented demand from China. read more

But farmers may not have as much to sell this year.

"The Washington wheat crop is in pretty rough shape right now," said Clark Neely, a Washington State University agronomist. The U.S. Agriculture Department this week rated 68% of the state's spring wheat and 36% of its winter wheat in poor or very poor condition. A year ago, just 2% of the state's winter wheat and 6% of its spring wheat were rated poor to very poor.

On top of the expected yield losses, grain buyers worry about quality. Flour millers turn to Pacific Northwest soft white wheat for its low protein content, which is well-suited for pastries and crackers.

But the drought is shriveling wheat kernels and raising protein levels, making the some of the crop less valuable. "The protein is so high that you can't use (it) for anything but cattle feed," Kress said.

Low-protein "soft" wheats have lower gluten content than the "hard" wheats used for bread, producing a less-stretchy dough for delicate cakes and crackers.

The Washington State Agriculture Department said it was still too early to estimate lost revenue from crop damage.

The heat peaked in late June, in the thick of the harvest of cherries. Temperatures reached 118 degrees Fahrenheit (48 Celsius) on June 28 at The Dalles, Oregon, along the Washington border, near the heart of cherry country.

Scientists have said the suffocating heat that killed hundreds of people would have been "virtually impossible" without climate change and such events could become more common. read more

The National Weather Service posted weekend heat advisories for eastern Washington.

NIGHTTIME CHERRY HARVEST; SUN NETS FOR APPLES

On the hottest days last month, laborers who normally start picking cherries at 4 a.m. began at 1 a.m., armed with headlamps and roving spotlights to beat the daytime heat that threatened their safety and made the fruit too soft to harvest.

The region should still produce a roughly average-sized cherry harvest, but not the bumper crop initially expected, said B.J. Thurlby, president of the Northwest Cherry Growers, a grower-funded trade group representing top cherry producer Washington and other Western states.

"We think we probably lost about 20% of the crop," Thurlby said, adding that growers simply had to abandon a portion of the heat-damaged cherries in their orchards.

The heat wave's impact on Washington's $2 billion apple crop - the state's most valuable agricultural product - is uncertain, as harvest is at least six weeks away. Apple growers are used to sleepless nights as they respond to springtime frosts, but have little experience with sustained heat in June.

"We really don't know what the effects are. We just have to ride it out," said Todd Fryhover, president of the Washington Apple Commission.

Growers have been protecting their orchards with expansive nets that protect fruit against sunburn, and by spraying water vapor above the trees. Apples have stopped growing for the time being, Fryhover said, but it is possible the crop may make up for lost time if weather conditions normalize.

The state wine board in Oregon, known for its Pinot Noir, said the timing of the heat spike may have benefited grapes. Last year, late-summer wildfires and wind storms forced some West Coast vineyards to leave damaged grapes unharvested.

Washington's wine grapes also seem fine so far, one vineyard manager said. "I think wine grapes are situated well to handle high heat in June," said Sadie Drury, general manager of North Slope Management.

410 Gone - Thoughts on Mark "diveintomark" Pilgrim's and _why's infosuicides
October 10, 2011 Comment on this post [66]
Posted in Blogging | Musings

I don't know Mark Pilgrim personally. I only know his work and it's excellent. I knew of him first from his Dive Into Accessibility almost a decade ago and later from his other "Dive Into" books that educated a young generation on Python, and most recently HTML 5.

Mark is alive, but online he's gone. He committed "infosuicide" last week. All of his websites are Gone. That's capital G, Gone. Not 404, Not Found, but the not-often-used HTTP Status 410. And this is where it gets concerning to me.

HTTP Status 410 states per the spec with emphasis mine:

Indicates that the resource requested is no longer available and will not be available again. This should be used when a resource has been intentionally removed and the resource should be purged. Upon receiving a 410 status code, the client should not request the resource again in the future. Clients such as search engines should remove the resource from their indices. Most use cases do not require clients and search engines to purge the resource, and a "404 Not Found" may be used instead.

As it says, most use cases don't call for removal from a search engine, but in this case, Mark literally and figuratively "took his ball and went home," no longer interested in playing.

The first major "infosuicide" of note was that of whytheluckystiff, author of Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby. No one knows why _why left, but a tweet just before he left said:

programming is rather thankless. u see your works become replaced by superior ones in a year. unable to run at all in a few more.

Perhaps one can glean some meaning from that. In a similar vein, in 2008 Mark blogged on minimalism and then before Twitter existed Mark Pilgrim blogged (almost 7 years ago this month) a microblogpost, preserved via the Wayback Machine:

It’s time for me to find a new hobby. Preferably one that doesn’t involve angle brackets. Or computers. Or electricity.

Why do I care? I'm exploring this as someone who has been blogging publically and effectively nonstop since 2002. That's almost a decade, Dear Reader. For me to leave, either willingly or unwillingly, after putting so much useful (presumably, says my ego) information out there would be one thing. But to leave AND remove all that information, declaring it Gone and asking that it no longer be indexed seems, on the surface, to be a selfish act.

I realize it costs money to keep a website up but it's typically not a crushing expense. If one wanted to retreat from online life (as I sometimes do) one could add a banner to their existing sites that says something like "I'm taking a break and teaching high school" or "I've become a non-technical ER nurse" or "I've opened a hair salon" (each has been a one-time fantasy job for me) and setup an email auto-responder. This extraction from being online wouldn't take more than a week of prep and would be perceived as a much classier - although not as dramatic - move than a disappearance hinging on an HTTP status code.

Even so, Erik Meyer quotes Mark in a 2003 post:

"Embracing HTTP error code 410 means embracing the impermanence of all things."
- Mark Pilgrim, March 27, 2003 (diveintomark.com)

That's an accurate albeit mighty metaphysical reading into the HTTP spec. Do bloggers/teachers/infopublishers have the right to leave the community? Of course. Do we have the right to control, and ultimately remove our content? Surely. But to put so much information out and to remove it seems unnecessary. Is it to much to ask to maintain ones own archive, if only for a little while?

I've always said two things. First, respect the permalink. Second, don't give bile a permalink. While a 410 isn't bile, it's not the most respectful way to disappear.

Reading into Mark's blog, it's obvious that being on the web didn't feed his spirit. It does leave one to wonder, when you pass on, will you be mirrored or just 410 Gone?

GONE

The requested resource /
is no longer available on this server and there is no forwarding address. Please remove all references to this resource.

I truly wish Mark all the best in his disconnected life, as I do anyone else who wants to disconnect. If they come back, we'll be here.

Mark asked to be Gone. You say it's his right.

Do we have the right to control, and ultimately remove our content? Surely

And yet you post mirrors into his work - the same work which he implicitly asked you to remove from your archives. Is that in any way more respectful than his request to disappear?

I don't think what Mark Pilgrim did was right. But it was his choice to make, and you would do well to respect it.
Dor "The Configurator" Kleiman
That's funny Dor, he published so much under GNU, shouldn't we be allowed to redistribute that information?
Cole Brand
I believe he has the right to remove his content, but Mark is someone who clearly believes in the HTTP spec, and by association, the web itself by his use of a 410. That said, I don't see how his use of 410 and the removal of this content implies that the rest of us should pretend it doesn't exist.

Do I as the author of a number of technical books have the right to reach into libraries and hard drives (My book is in PDF form) and remove ALL remnants of my publically published material? Surely not. I can only delete the source.

I don't see how publishing mirrors to this content, or the good work of the mirrors themselves, is anything other than a gesture of respect to Mark and his educational works.
Scott Hanselman
Don't agree Dor, once you put something online, it takes on another life as it disseminates into the public domain. That info can be used and recorded by other people, and perhaps, just perhaps, it's lifespan should be determined by it's value to others?
Dash
Not only that, but Mark's "Dive Into" works were licensed under CC-BY-3.0. They are Creative Commons.
Scott Hanselman
The sender would like to recall website.

Honestly, this is why licenses on everything are so important. Not just on code, but on content in general.
Jon Galloway
This is already an interesting debate. Ironically, I think it's the fact that everything online is forever that leads people to commit "infosuicide" in an attempt to reboot their lives. For better or worse, there really is no way to disappear online, as is being demonstrated here. I wish we could collectively just let people move on and be okay with that, but I also understand that's never going to happen.
Kevin Krueger
Playing devils advocate...

We can't assume to know what has motivated Mark from pulling his stuff online except that he no longer wishes for his content to be made available.

This is a case of what you're legally allowed to do and what the author would like you to do, i.e. Morally vs Legally. You say this is a 'gesture of respect' but it goes directly against his personal wishes. He can't stop you from doing it, but he has implicitly asked everyone to remove references to his content.

Although this is a morally tricky situation and there is no right answer, either everyone respects his wishes and the world loses valuable repository of information or we respect the original authors wishes and remove his content.
Demis Bellot
Interestingly, Dive into HTML 5 explicitly says "The Work shall remain online under the CC-BY-3.0 License," which in turn says "You are free: to Share — to copy, distribute and transmit the work [...]." This kinda suggests that Pilgrim was willing at some point to give up (some) control of this work.

Anyway, it's a loss to us that he won't be posting any more (also true of whytheluckystiff). Hope they're doing ok in their new, non-online lives.

This reminds me of when I was playing Diablo II. I told myself I had to stop playing, but always returned to it. It was only when I deleted my character, the game, and gave away the discs, that I was able to finally tear myself away from it.

Mike Sax
I totally agree with Dor. Uncool dude. There is a difference between what you can do and what you should do.


Random John
It does leave one to wonder, when you pass on, will you be mirrored or just 410 Gone.


As someone who more and more often feels burnt out, I find this statement deeply inspiring.
Nicholas Piasecki
So you all are saying that 410 Gone means 410 "Recall" and his intent is that he no longer wishes his content to be available AT ALL ON THE WEB.

I want to point out that he could have said that in his Gone text at http://www.diveintomark.org. Why are we debating about his intent when he hasn't expressed it?
Scott Hanselman
All that can be inferred from the 410 is that he wants his website taken down. Those who suggest this means mirrors must also be taken down are extrapolating without evidence
KevDog
Relevant parts emphasized in bold:

http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html



10.4.11 410 Gone

The requested resource is no longer available at the server and no forwarding address is known. This condition is expected to be considered permanent. Clients with link editing capabilities SHOULD delete references to the Request-URI after user approval. If the server does not know, or has no facility to determine, whether or not the condition is permanent, the status code 404 (Not Found) SHOULD be used instead. This response is cacheable unless indicated otherwise.

The 410 response is primarily intended to assist the task of web maintenance by notifying the recipient that the resource is intentionally unavailable and that the server owners desire that remote links to that resource be removed. Such an event is common for limited-time, promotional services and for resources belonging to individuals no longer working at the server's site. It is not necessary to mark all permanently unavailable resources as "gone" or to keep the mark for any length of time -- that is left to the discretion of the server owner.

Demis Bellot
He has expressed intend. 410. intentionally gone.

A mirror isn't selective, mirror the 410.




Random John
'infosuicide' is an unfortunate neologism, especially when combined with the word 'commit'.

There can be literally no comparison with actual suicide; even these most dramatic of digital leavings lacks the defining characteristic of the real act: permanence.

It is also troubling to repurpose the term that concludes the most sorrowful and nihilistic of human conditions to describe what amounts to no more than an online hissy fit.


Ben
I just finished reading "The Moon and Sixpence" by Somerset Maugham(http://bit.ly/b08SPQ) it is about this very idea.

What responsibility does the artist have to society? Should a great work of art be destroyed merely at the whim of the artist? Or once it has been created, does it belong to society at large? Do other people, have some claim to the existence of such a work?

The creative commons license is certainly implying the rights of society to the creation of art.
Peter Drew
First of all, I never implied you weren't within your rights to distribute this content. It is freely available with a CC license, so clearly you are.

Second, I'm pretty sure that 410 Gone is a statement saying "I no longer wish you to have this content."

I do not presume to know Mr. Pilgrim's situation or what his wishes are; I'm also not saying what you're doing is morally wrong. All I'm saying is, don't say it is disrespectful of him to deny access to his content while posting the very same content.
Dor "The Configurator" Kleiman
Also, to all of you calling Scott out on posting mirrors to Mark Pilgrim's content: what part of "creative commons license" don't you understand?

Moreover, we're not talking about his personal blog here. What pain or difficulty will he experience through the continued use of his works? -- none, unless he is pathologically insecure or selfish.
Ben
woah, woah, woah. every digital analogy is a pale ghost by comparison with their real-life counterparts. I think that's understood. Mark purposefully terminated the original source and output of his online identity, which can be thought of as a separate entity. the analogy fits.
John Batte
Ben,

You misunderstand, no-one has said that it's not under CC nor that he hasn't a legal right to do so, only that it likely goes against the authors wishes.



Moreover, we're not talking about his personal blog here. What pain or difficulty will he experience through the continued use of his works? -- none, unless he is pathologically insecure or selfish.



So anyone who wishes to recall his own works is immediately pathologically insecure and selfish? Although removing his work will only serve as a detriment to others I'm not so quick to judge others motives.
Demis Bellot
Mark Pilgrim is a (very) smart guy, and I am pretty sure he stands by his agreements. He licensed much of his content under Creative Commons Attribution License, which means it's perfectly fine to mirror as long as you give attribution.

If Mark takes down his site it means he no longer chooses to host this content, nothing more. Second guessing and accusing others of disrespecting imaginary intentions is futile.
Mike Sax
@Dor: Scott never actually said it was disrespectful of him. He said on the surface it seems like a selfish act. While I understand your point, I personally do not take issue with Scott's actions. In fact, I chuckled when I saw the link list at the bottom because I thought intentional or otherwise it was a satisfyingly subtle FU to (what on the surface seems to me to be) an act of douchebaggery regardless of Pilgrim's intent or rights whatever they may be. Certainly not a high crime but a dick move in my book.
brianhartung.myopenid.com
Dor - Thanks for your comment! I think, then, we agree on most things except I interpret 410 Gone as "This link is no longer valid for this resource." and "I no longer wish to host it, don't look here again." I don't take it as meaning "I no longer wish this content to be available on the web." That is a far-reaching statement that is WAY outside the HTTP Spec, and also not inline with the content licenses.
Scott Hanselman
The author's wishes, if you can read into a brief 410 message to this degree, are that people remove links to his now-empty site.

You (and many others here) are inferring, with no evidence, that he also wants all mirrors and reproductions to be removed--which is a frankly ridiculous assumption; he of all people would know what a pointless and destructive demand that would be.

And, since you asked, I would question the emotional maturity of someone who would make that demand. It's just that I see no reason to believe that's the case here.
Ben
Oops. My last comment @ Demis Bellot.
Ben
It doesn't go away. He posted it to the web. Who here doesn't know that web content gets indexed, mirrored, and archived? You can take your content, return 410, but he should know that his content will not disappear, and he really has no control, or expectation that it will disappear. Intending it to vanish will not make it so. Once he posted it, it's no longer his alone. We have read rights to it forever.
Scott Slack
The idea of reversibility on the internet is as foreign as security or privacy. The is no bill of internet rites, by executing a POST in plain text that information is public domain whether you want it or not.

It's like saying, "if I stop drinking in the morning, you can't blame me for what happened last night."
Craig D
Suicide is a belligerent act. It's done to hurt someone.

He may have been depressed and unhappy, but when it comes down to it, this Mark guy just wanted to hurt someone. Maybe all of us.
Bryan Livingston
What his intentions are now and what they were before when he was actively contributing his works are likely very different. Although I'm sure he is aware that he has no recourse in being able to recall his CC published works.

But what is his most likely intention? my belief is by using a 410 is if he wants his content removed. There is no more deliberate HTTP status code he could've used to show this intent. If he was ok with his content being mirrored I believe a 404 would be more appropriate, or if he didn't care what happened - just let his domain get parked. But he didn't, he actively opted into returning a 410 a code.

I also don't necessarily think this is a deliberate act with the intention of actively hurting others, my guess is its depression-related along the lines of recently realizing he has misspent his youth on an unfulfilling path and wants to eradicate all traces of this from his memory.

Although due to the Babara Streisand effect he would have a good platform if he came back and published 1 last book before becoming a recluse - my opinion is it would be a best seller! :)
Demis Bellot
While we are being pedantic about the meaning of 410 Gone, I would like to point out that if Mark Pilgrim's works existed at some mirror site that had a different URI then that work is in fact a different resource.

Resources should only have one URI that returns a 200, the rest should redirect (as per Issue#14 - Range http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2005Jun/0039.html).

Therefore issuing a 410 Gone does not apply to the content at a different URI that returns a 200. And therefore issuing 410 Gone does not apply to mirrored content.

If you choose to debate this point, please include your opinions on what should be done with derivative works. :-)
@Dor, @Demis, Let's try a different argument. Say I gave you a gift, a painting. Then a year later I tell you, give me back my painting. Are you under any moral grounds whatsoever to return the painting?

In fact, that analogy doesn't go far enough to describe what Mark did when he chose to license his content under the Creative Commons. Creative Commons is modelled after the concept of The Commons.



The commons is terminology referring to resources that are owned in common or shared between or among communities populations. These resources are said to be "held in common" and can include everything from natural resources and common land to software.


Thus I'd argue, even if his intention was to recall all the content, you're not under any moral obligation to give the gift back. In fact, I'd say you're morally obligated to continue sharing the content. It's as if a person donated a library to the public and then decided that he wanted it back and everyone should get out.

But I don't think you can even argue that 410 means Mark's intention is to ask for all the copies of the content to be taken down. 410 refers to "the resource" which is the item specified by the URI. A copy of the content hosted elsewhere is a different resource. Mark understood HTTP. He would know 410 doesn't convey recall. If that's what he really wanted, he would've removed the content and replaced them with a page making his intentions clear.

It's way too much to read into 410 that he wants his content removed from the web. I think a more reasonable interpretation of a 410 is to think of it as a permanent 404.

10.4.11 410 Gone

The requested resource is no longer available at the server and no forwarding address is known. This condition is expected to be considered permanent. Clients with link editing capabilities SHOULD delete references to the Request-URI after user approval. If the server does not know, or has no facility to determine, whether or not the condition is permanent, the status code 404 (Not Found) SHOULD be used instead. This response is cacheable unless indicated otherwise.
As the W3 points out


The 410 response is primarily intended to assist the task of web maintenance by notifying the recipient that the resource is intentionally unavailable and that the server owners desire that remote links to that resource be removed. Such an event is common for limited-time, promotional services and for resources belonging to individuals no longer working at the server's site. It is not necessary to mark all permanently unavailable resources as "gone" or to keep the mark for any length of time -- that is left to the discretion of the server owner.

So what's the correct Status Code he would use if he wanted all his works to be removed?

If we're going to use a gift analogy lets use something similar to what it actually is - written literature on a website.

Say you're were writer in an religious faith who is hosting some propaganda on a website under a CC licence that you truly believed in at the time. During this time a church found your writing so persuasive it was also mirroring content off your site. Then a fundamental event occurs that shakes your belief system and you no longer believe in what you wrote so you took down your website. At this time you also wish the church mirror to stop hosting your works so your efforts are not used to recruit others. What status code do you use in this case? and does the church have a moral obligation to respect your wishes then?

Although if this were case he would've actively taken measures to express his intent which is obviously not the case here. So this scenario, although closer to what actually happened, just like giving a painting gift - isn't what happened either. We don't need to hypothesise about another scenario we can use what we know.

He didn't actively express his intent to remove his content from all mirrors (in a way he had no right to ask). But he has actively taken steps to remove all traces of his digital life, that he could do without communicating with or imposing himself onto others. My belief If he only wanted to detach himself from his works (and would've preferred it to live without him) he would've zipped it up and put it on a torrent somewhere which would've taken less effort than digitally erasing himself. He didn't do anything like this.

At what point are you morally obliged to respect his wishes? What would be your opinion if he asked mirrors to stop hosting, would you be inclined to do so then?

Nope I genuinely think he just doesn't want to see any of his works in circulation anymore in the same way some would tear-up an ex-partners photos after a bad break-up and would not want to ever see or hear from them again - out of sight, out of mind.

No doubt Mark's an intelligent guy and theres a very real and concerning reason behind what motivated him to digitally delete himself. My guess is at one stage he found helping others rewarding, hopefully there is a chance he can use his talents to help others at some time in the future again.

409 - So until he re-connects back online, I wont be mirroring his content :)

It’s time for me to find a new hobby. Preferably one that doesn’t involve angle brackets. Or computers. Or electricity.


Yes, maybe a good choice... to take some time to see the world before it is all "eaten by software". Not waste it bickering about the meaning of a HTTP status code and what he might have meant with it.

This discussion is ridicilous. Everyone in their right mind knows that the internet remembers all. In a decade filled with "information gone AWOL" through accusations against Facebook and cases like Wikileaks, we should know by now that information isn't recalled or permanently deleted from the web.

I don't know Dave - not in real life, nor from blogs - but my impression after reading this post is that Dave is/was a fairly seasoned techie. In that sense I would say it's more disrespectful, and even an insult of his intelligence, to imply that he expected the 410 to make everyone remove his work from their mirrors/usbsticks/e-readers/print-outs.

The way I see it, Dave wanted to disconnect, start over. That's fine and we should respect that. Respecting his decision, however, does not mean drawing false conclusions or implying Daves naivety.

Scotts post is as always well written and to the point, and it raises an important point not directly related to Daves story; If you don't want your information shared or copied. Don't post it on the web.
Yngve Nilsen
Not quite sure why I wrote "Dave" - as I of cource meant Mark.
Yngve Nilsen
@Yngve

Mark is not an ordinary seasoned techie or web developer, he's of rare intelligence with an intimate knowledge of web technologies like few do. I will be the last person to be challenge his understanding of any web protocol or standard.

And I thought I was speculating, you're insinuating I'm disrepectful? insultive of his intelligence and bleeding blind naivety? because I think we should respect his wishes? nice conclusion hopping (and use of bold text, I see your point).

You seem to think he's having a case of the Mondays where he just wants to disconnect, pick up his toys and go play with something else. I personally think his issues are a tad deeper than that. Where someone who has dedicated most of his career learning technology has reached the point where he's deleted his online identity, excuse me for being cynical, but I don't think he's set his computer to hibernate and just started his lawn mower. I think he would prefer his works, like the rest of his digital life to be erased -- but evidently that's just me.

And like everyone else you're more than entitled to your opinion - feel free to explain how you've reached yours.



If you don't want your information shared or copied. Don't post it on the web.



Great advice - and how well does this insightful little gem work after the fact?

Anyway I'm flogging a dead point here, and it looks like this thread has just started picking up some valuable contributions, I'll be steppin' outside - feel free to continue the discussion.

Demis Bellot
I don't interpret the 410 as a global recall of information.

The reason I would use a 410 is because I know that when the domain expires it will be snatched up by a domainer who wants to fill the page with adverts. They do this to benefit from the residual traffic sent to quality sites by search engines and back links.

By using the 410 status code, you empty the search engine indexes and tell people to remove the back links. This doesn't just prevent some domainer from squatting on your old domain trying to monetise your visitors, it also gives everyone a chance to switch their links to another source of the information.

We can only guess what Mark Pilgrim intended with the 410. If only he had used a custom 410 error page to explain his intent. Without any such notice of intent, we have to take the simplistic view that he just didn't want to run his site any longer - we shouldn't try to extrapolate further meaning about removal of legal copies and extracts.
Steve Fenton
I would have to agree with @haacked that the use of 410 in this instance is just the mechanical means of saying, "I'm ending this website, I want my sites off of Google searches, stop looking here for stuff." That's all the evidence we will have to go off of, a mechanical http status. I believe anything beyond that is an emotional assumption that we would make given what we've seen so far.

With that being said, I do wish him the best of luck. Whatever his intentions are, most of us have greatly appreciated the work he has provided to the community.

Perhaps it has something to do with his August 23, 2010 post where Mark writes:

[...] you should all be reading Tweetage Wasteland and then unplugging everything you own, just like I am and have.
Scott
Part of the psychological aspects stem from a desire to build/make/create things with some sense of permanence. A lasting result. Our grandparents made things we can often still touch or use. We make things with bits and bytes, about as permanent as sand castles on a beach. If that bothers someone, they need to find another career.
David Stein
@Haacked:
I never said that what Scott did was morally wrong. I said it was not respecting Mark's wishes, according to what Scott wrote in his article.
Dor "The Configurator" Kleiman
A good friend of mine committed infosuicide some years back. It was nothing against his online life - I have good reason to believe that he misses his 'Net family, which included Electric Minds - but because he was taking a job in a public library. It was easier and faster to clean up his online presence by bulldozing it off than trying to sift through and just bleach the stains.

When I finally save enough to be able to go luddite, I will likely do much the same. If none of my postings or sites exist, I won't wonder what other people are commenting or posting in response...

Denise Evans
His wishes regarding his works were already explicitly disseminated, with the creative commons license.

It is in no way disrespectful to publish links to a mirror, or publish the actual content on a different resource, as long as you follow the licensing requirements. Assuming anything else is absurd.

His 'wishes' regarding the 410 status should not even be in debate. There is but one meaning of this 410 status. The URI that returns this status is gone, removed, not intended to come back. That is what he informed us with this. He intends not to come back to this. Perhaps he also intended this lively debate as an instructive exercise on HTTP.

I hope Mark is having fun with his disconnected life, and I thank him for the amazing work he leaves behind. It is apparent that whatever he chooses to do, he will succeed and excel in that.

Peace.
Gary Leonard
Infocide. 410 style.
Michael Perryman
I would say the 410 is more like a book publisher closing down and shuttering its doors. It means the content will no longer be published there and there is no reason to come back later looking for it. The content is now out of print.

But if a book publisher stops publishing a book that doesn't mean they get to come take back the book you have, or that you are intended to burn the book. It doesn't mean it is removed from libraries or other locations.

All it means is that the content is no longer published by the original source. Sure the web is a different beast, but especially for CC licensed works the idea is essentially the same. You can stop publishing it, but you don't get to take it back from those who have it.

My opinion comes from an entirely different perspective than what I've seen in the comments.

I am a consumer of (primarily developer-produced) content. I read & reference & recommend. I occasionally create & publish content... but only if I discover a solution I can't find online & think it could be helpful.

We're a community. Content gets written because there is a need.

Just last week, a recruiter for a Dallas Silverlight position called my CELL phone. Instead of getting pissy, asking how he got my cell number, I told him I knew of someone, via Twitter, looking for a Silverlight job in Dallas.

The recruiter proceeded to tell me he was aware of Twitter, but hadn't really wrapped his head around it. (To which I gasped and) I referred him to this very web site & told him to read Scott's Twitter section.

My point is, If Scott's posts on Twitter 101 didn't exist, someone else would write one. If Scott's posts on Twitter weren't good enough, someone would write a better one. Because they exist (with permalinks), others can focus their attention on creating other NEEDED content, with faith that useful content of the past will exist in some form, as it's the nature of the internet.

I suspect there were many books & blog posts that were NOT written BECAUSE Mark Pilgrim created "Dive Into Accessibility almost a decade ago and later from his other 'Dive Into' books that educated a young generation on Python, and most recently HTML 5."

He educated a young generation on Python? What if Jeff Atwood decided to go 410 tomorrow, taking Stack Overflow with it? How devastating would that be? How many people would that affect? If that example doesn't resonate because it's not his personal blog, how would we, in the .NET Stack, feel if Scott Guthrie went 410? We all reference his great blog posts. How would SQL devs feel if Pinal Dave, or [person whose blog has content that YOU reference] took down their blogs & went 410?

I'm not saying I think if I've seen it on the web that it will exist forever, but there are things we reference online & depend on (and we all kind of feel that way, no?)

I know you might want to flame something like, "Do I think it's not a possibility that any given link might return a 404/410 someday?" Of course it's a possibility, but what am I supposed to do, go mirror everything I've ever found useful so I'll have a reference just in case there's a zombie apocalypse? Come on, none of us have time for that.

There are many, many blog posts that people aren't writing because the content exists. If you think it's not harmful to take your content down just because it's content that was written by you, I beg you to consider the possibility that the content would have been written by someone else AND WASN'T because you published it, first & publicly, and it resonated.

If Scott decided to 410 Hanselman.com, I would feel betrayed. Why? I don't know Scott. How would I feel personally betrayed by someone I don't even know? Because Scott's passion has driven him to make contributions the community finds valuable, so in my eyes, I would see it as a selfish betrayal of community.

That being said, I'm not insinuating he doesn't have every right to do such a thing, but from what I know of him through posts, I would believe that would only happen if a part of him that once existed so vibrantly - that drive to teach, that drive to help, that drive to mentor, had died.

I am not familiar with Mark Pilgram's work, but if he once cared enough to become known for a series of deep dive books, that is not something that happens to someone who didn't once have a spark or a zest or a passion for it. We can all assume we think we know what his wishes are now, but I can guarantee that if Hanselman went 410 tonight, I'd be spending tomorrow trying to find & archive a mirror of his site of my own to keep & reference. And quite honestly, I'd also mourn the loss of a passion that once burned so bright.
@coridrew
I'm more concerned that we lose Mark Pilgrim's future contributions forever. What he posted has been very valuable, and not lost as they're being archived. But no one can re-create his future contributions. BTW, is Mark Pilgrim employed by Google? What's also strange was he committed info suicide in the same week that Steve Jobs passed away. Maybe just coincidental...
kevinle.myopenid.com
A 410 literally just requests that other sites should no longer link to the content, there is no statement regarding content mirroring.

And if he had used the usual 404, everyone would be assuming there was an error on his site and the target was missing (or hacked, or whatever).

Yes, we would have preferred Mark to put up a simple custom message stating his actual intent - but then wouldn't we be debating his reasons? Or if he stated his reasons, would we be analyzing them?

At least we can assume that he didn't intend "Gone until I get the attention I deserve" (HTTP 447).
Brett Stanley
Scott,

You are not gonna do something like that, are you? if you are, I am going to make a copy of all your blog posts right now!
Tugberk
Thanks for linking the mirrors, when I first heard about this "infocide" or w/e my first thought was "I knew I should've dl'd jump into html5 when I had the chance".
David Fauber
I'm thinking 'committed infocide' sounds a bit nasty.

What about 'gone to fly model pterodactyls'?
Simon Needham
HTML codes do not alter contracts. If he wanted to alter the content licensing, he need to actually alter the license directly. A couple of people here have dug in and are doing little more than ‘reading tea leaves’.

@Demis, “He didn't actively express his intent to remove his content from all mirrors (in a way he had no right to ask). But he has actively taken steps to remove all traces of his digital life, that he could do without communicating with or imposing himself onto others.”

You cannot have it both ways, you have been insisting that the code published by him communicating with others. People have already explained to you that you’re reading into his motives. As to ‘in a way he had no right to ask’, his rights are clearly outlined by the license he used. He does, in fact, have those rights. That he did not invoke those rights are far more telling than your assumptions of some html code overriding a legal contract.

sgmarshall.myopenid.com
If only Microsoft would use 410 instead of just randomly pulling content...
Blugh
a@http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosuicide@Wikipedia's Infosuicide article seems to have taken it literally.

(Or was it pushed...)
quercus.livejournal.com
Like the blog due to impressive article submitter

nl.777bonus.com
I had no idea Mark had 'passed': we take a holiday from October 1 to the last week of December each year and don't interact with anyone off-island.

As we were preparing to go, I decided I wanted to spend some (concentrated) time with Mark's Dive Into HTML5, but since we are without 'net access for two months I archived a copy of his site for off-line review.

It's so odd to learn Mark deleted himself and I'm so glad I didn't delete the copy of Mark's site from my computer after I read through it: I have the O'Reilly book, but the site is so much more beautiful.

I feel a little like I did the day I found my brother's gloves the year after he died. I couldn't throw them away, but didn't want to use them either.

Good luck Mark. Enjoy whatever you are doing now. Thanks for everything.
Jake
Congratulations on your almost 10 years of blogging, and for refusing to commit "infosuicide". Love the term. Believe it or not this is the first time I've heard it.

Good thoughts - thanks.
Jan Roos
Interesting article, definitely food for a lot of thought. Would write a mini essay on it but maybe when I'm not on my iPhone...
Justice~!
Thanks , Nice post really like your writing style , I have recently been seeking for facts about this topic for ages and yours is the best I've located so far , I learn something more difficult on unique blogs everyday . to read content from other writers and practice just a little something from them . I prefer to use some using the content on my weblog whether you don't mind . Thanks for sharing.

Okay, so, someone posted a "404" joke, which led me to think of the "410" that Mark pulled. Mark and I were buddies in college. The chatter I'm coming across after doing a Google search combining his name and 410 is just gold. Knowing Mark as I do, I can assure you. He is just flat out laughing his ass off at everyone, just like he did with all the fan mail he used to get from wanna-be hackers in 1993. Oh Mark, I miss you!

Hello there! I recently need to give a massive flashes
up for your great info you've got right here with this submit. I will apt to be coming back to your web site for additional shortly.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Blue Boat
07/12/2021

 Hoagie at the helm of Blue Boat. Adrian in his beach lounger.

I told this story a couple weeks ago to a guy who was interested in buying a majority interest in a company I started. For some reason, likely my very theatrical imagination, I thought I should have some kinda..monologue so that when Stephen Soderberg does my biopic he has some good material to work with for this pivotal moment.
Or maybe it’s Tarantino because he does long monologue-y shots, right? Like in Reservoir Dogs?
At the time it felt like a good way to lay the ground as the purpose of this call was to figure out whether my vision for the company was aligned with his vision for his majority share.
The story starts with “Hoagie” — his name is Jim — who has a place on a little island you never heard of called Culebra.
It’s off of Puerto Rico and it takes a day or two to get there from New York City, when I used to go there while I was living in New York City. You’d fly to San Juan and then you’d want to load up on supplies while in San Juan. Steaks for the grill. Fresh produce. Booze. Bug spray. Another bathing suit. Toilet paper. That kind of thing.
And then you’d catch a ferry, but you’d have to get to the ferry with your supplies so you’d rent a utility vehicle of some description (this was before they were called SUVs) or get a taxi and it was a schlepp with all those steaks and jugs of booze and probably not enough bug spray and what you think is too much toilet paper but you can never have enough, really.
And once you got to Culebra you’d figure out the room situation. There were four rooms, each room is at one of the corners of the modest, small, lovely bungalow with the big open common area and the deck in front and the miniature amphitheater in the back where the evening’s micro performances, re-enactments of the day’s antics, Charades, etc., would unfold.
Hoagie’s bungalow was just across a basically untraveled narrow road that you’d cross there, and then it was a few steps down to the bay.
And moored just there was a blue boat called Blue Boat. 
It was a skiff. That might be the most generously ambiguous description.
An unremarkable fiberglass boat with maybe two benches that were not infrequently augmented with a low-slung beach-style folding chair that was probably at some earlier occasion picked up while in San Juan along with the steaks and bug spray.
We’d take gallon plastic milk jugs, close the top tight, and tuck them under the transom or up along the bow or under the seats for “floatation.”
I never entirely understood that, but that’s what we did. To make Blue Boat a bit more stable? Was that even possible?
Honestly, with an inconsequential level of effort, I’m confident that Blue Boat could be swamped were I to grab opposite gunwales and rock to-and-fro until I found a resonance frequency for the rocking and Blue would sorta shrug and roll right over.
There were four things that would happen every day, along with unexpected things like a random backgammon game or reading one of the books that accumulated in the house library.
Thing 1: Talk about what we were going to make for dinner, at around 7:30 in the morning. Over coffee.
Thing 2: Eat what we decided to make for dinner at around 6:30 in the evening.
Thing 3: Morning fly fishing for the elusive and rascally Bonefish
Thing 3: Afternoon fly fishing for the elusive and rascally Bonefish.
We went fly fishing one afternoon. It’s sorta funny because I’m not a fly fisherman by any stretch and particularly alongside Adrian and Hoagie — I’m not even an outside-man, let alone an outdoorsman.
We’ve known each other since, like..grade school and both of those guys moved to Wyoming immediately after college and have been there ever since.
They can do things like field dress an Elk with as much bother and consternation as I have loading a dishwasher.
(By the way, to “field dress” an Elk is the extreme opposite of, you know, putting clothes on an Elk, if you follow.) 
But, I’ll play along and practice casting and, heck — standing up to your knees in crystal clear salt water while playing fly-fisherman half a mile from shore during low tide in a Caribbean bay isn’t so bad.
The way it works is like this. We motor out in Blue Boat and we each pick a spot typically a 100 yards or some such away from each other. The way I remember things is I was driving Blue Boat and dropped the fellers off and then found a spot for myself and made like I was a fly fisherman.
Back then I could bore pretty easily so here I am realizing that practice may not make perfect, at least not in the next 30 minutes, and I can’t even see any fish and the water is crystalline. I decide there’s nothing here to catch.
I let some time pass and it’s starting to get hot and maybe it’s time for cocktails so I clamber into Blue Boat which is pretty easy because the water is pretty shallow.
I give Blue a bit of a shove to send ‘er in the direction of deeper water and clamber in, lower the motor and start it up and head towards Adrian who was closest to me. Adrian clambers in and we take a look around, nod at the serenity of the place and then wonder if we should go over there and get Hoagie. We squint in the distance to see if he’s giving us some sorta..you know..signal or whatever.
Hard to tell so, well — let’s motor closer and see what’s what and so me being me I open ‘er up but good and off we go.
A moment. Maybe two, and then Blue Boat stalls out. Just stops.
Damnit, what?
“Motor stop?”, Adrian asks. I just glance at him and blink twice. I look back at the engine and gesture at it with two open palms and a shrug and say, “Yeah. The motor stopped, I’m pretty sure of that.”
Adrian gets out of his lawn chair situation with determination. He’s an amazing worker. Works on anything that needs working on.
“Well, hit the priming bulb there and, well..”, he said.
I looked at him and looked at the engine and that rubber priming bulb thing and said, “Awwww’right.”
Couple of squeeze-y-squeeks of the primer bulb and then I half-asked/told him “Start ‘er?”
“Yuuuuup”, Adrian drawled.
And then now the fuck what? How’d I end up in the water, is what I’m wondering. And who is that behind me saying, just as calm as if whispering to a sleeping kitten, “Dude. Don’t get cut.”
That’s Adrian behind me — he must be in the water too — saying, “Dude. Don’t get cut.”
And then I see Blue Boat and it’s not underneath me but off over there and she’s running flat out and, oh right — I didn’t twist the throttle off when that motor stalled out so, well — I guess it started and we just got tumbled out from the sudden jolt. Everyone from on the boat is now in the water. The both of us. And that “Dude. Don’t get cut” must be because that motor has a propeller down there below the waterline and well — most of me is now below the waterline. So, like..huh.
I’ve read about boating accidents before. This might be one of them actually happening, I guess?
Now, I’ll be straight with you. I could make my self-rescue epic so that when Michael Bay has to take over from Soderberg he’ll have something requiring six days of shooting for 18 seconds of screen time and even an opportunity for an explosion or two to work with. But it didn’t go that way. All I remember is Adrian’s “don’t get cut” advisory and thinking, “I’m getting back in that fucking Blue Boat because there are a fair number of big luxury yachts at the other end of the bay and boy would that be a boating accident story, I tell you what.”
Plus I didn’t want to die. So there was that on top of the Blue Boat torpedo scenario.
I don’t know if it was physics or what but somehow the motor torqued and turned and is now setting Blue Boat on a circular course so she’s coming back at us and then I’ve got my arm hooked up to my elbow on the gunwale and find myself flat on my back in Blue Boat looking up at blue sky and then here comes Adrian who’s saying something to the effect of, “Cut the engine! Cut the engine!”
So, like..I cut the engine.
And then we had the most maniacal wide-eyed laugh I’ve ever had before or since.
“Did you see that?!”
“Dude. See it? Are you kidding me?? I was fucking there! Did you see that? Who does that kinda thing? Do we do that kinda thing now, the fuck?!”
We sat there for 10 minutes taking stock and shaking from the adrenaline. The event couldn’t have lasted more than 45 seconds, if that. Everything was out of scale. The speed of being tossed out. Blue Boat being so far away so quickly. The small feeling of being so far below the gunwales as Blue Boat got closer. And suddenly back in the boat in such a way that seemed positively beyond my abilities.
Have you ever tried to get back in a boat while in the water up to your chin? Have you? I mean..
Finally settled, we start the engine again according to well-established procedures, also known as ‘common sense.”
As we putter over to Hoagie, Adrian whispers conspiratorially, “Let’s not tell Hoagie.”
“Uhhh..okay?”
Hoagie is one of the mellowest dudes I know. He only gets out of an open toe shoe situation when it snows at his home in Jackson Hole. He’s just a mellow open-toe kinda guy.
Hoagie clambers in with his gear and I start motoring us back. After a few minutes he says with a smirk and just as casual as you please, “So..what were you guys doing, anyway?”
Needless to say, we made good use of the jugs of booze that evening.
I tell you that story to tell you this one.
Recently the missus was visiting Jackson Hole and had opportunity to stop in and have a meal with Hoagie. I told her, even though she knows it, “Get him to tell you the Blue Boat story. He tells it good.”
After he told it, he added a coda.
“You know, some guy offered me $500 for Blue Boat.”
“I told him I would rather see Blue Boat rotted out and sunk than sell it.”
I can totally see Hoagie saying that, standing there open-toe with a can of suds in his hand, maybe. Or one of those Titleist golf visors high on his forehead and a golf-gloved hand grasping a yard sale 4 iron.
He’d say it without a hint of malice nor a dose of contempt. More a statement of clarification.
That’s not just a shitty fiberglass skiff missing a bench and in dire need of floatation.
That boat? It’s full of sweat and stories and good adventures and days on end without a single fish caught. And more days on end of variously crappy fishing, great fishing and trips to town to watch the island play softball against itself or sit at that one open air bar that sits on the bay.
You clearly don’t get what it is.
It’s not a blue boat.
It’s Blue Boat.
You can’t value Blue Boat that way. With a number. Not like that. You’re not seeing Blue Boat. You’re just seeing a blue boat.
So. That’s the story I told that guy, that self-proclaimed numbers guy, whose transparency as to his capitalist proclivities I appreciated. I may have even envied them.
I told that guy the Blue Boat story, with neither a hint of malice nor a dose of contempt. The story was just a statement of clarification.

Should I get a standing desk? It’s a question more, and more people are asking. Especially now that millions are adjusting to working from home due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Standing desks are cropping up in workplaces, coworking spaces, and home offices around the country. But do they really make you healthier?

And can it be as easy as a using DIY standing desk solution, such as an ironing board standing desk on your hotel room coffee table? We dive into the science in this article, and both Alex and I weigh in with our combined 12 years of standing desk experience.

Should you get a standing desk? Let’s find out.

should i get a standing desk?

When I was in sales in Texas, I had a customer, Randy, who spent 8-10 hours a day at his standing desk. Randy was very passionate and vocal about the positive change the standing desk brought to his life.

He preached that his standing desk habit healed his chronic lower back pain. After 12-hour days waking the pits of the Texas Motor Speedway, he felt strong and robust instead of achy and exhausted.

Randy went on to share that after a long day at the office, he had the energy to complete his “honey-do-list” (Alex hates this term, by the way) instead of collapsing on the couch.

I was impressed by his newfound energy. But, I was much younger than Randy, and my daily exercise seemed adequate. Plus, I spent most of my workday driving my car. 

Is A Standing Desk Worth It? 

After my talk with Randy, I admittedly blew off the idea of getting a standing desk at home. Then, a week later, while the concept was still fresh in my mind, my friend gave me a cheap Chinese version of the FitBit.

Honestly, I never wanted one. I already knew I was inactive, and I didn’t need hourly guilt trips via beeps and vibrations from my wrist. 

But, I strapped it on anyway. Since I averaged 25-35 hours a week driving, I was lucky to hit 3,000 steps a day during the workweek. Some days as low as 2,000 steps. 

My new accountability buddy strapped to my wrist prompted me to research. I dove into the benefits of standing desks.

I knew that I had a much larger issue, being inactive. But, could using a standing desk be a small, easy habit change that would nudge me into a more active lifestyle?

What Are The Health Benefits Of Standing Desks?

I was aware of the studies coming out showing that sitting too much may shorten your life, but I didn’t realize how bad my sitting habit was until I ran my typical day through this sitting-time calculator.

This calculator determines “Risk for Sitting Disease.” 

LOW risk – sitting less than 4 hours per day
MEDIUM risk – sitting 4 to 8 hours per day
HIGH risk – sitting 8 to 11 hours per day
VERY HIGH risk – sitting 11+ hours per day

My results:

In addition to learning that my sitting habit was far worse than I thought, I learned that I was not capitalizing on easy calorie burn.

Your body burns about half the calories sitting as it does standing. Which, as a 6’1″ male weighing 175 pounds, meant that swapping four hours of sitting for standing could help me burn about 200 more calories. 

Increased daily caloric deficit benefits your waistline, but also reduces your risk of heart attack, stroke, diabetes, and cancer. 

If you’re wondering how many calories are burned at a standing desk, it depends on your weight, height, age, and gender. You can use the tables in this article to estimate your standing desks vs sitting calories. 

I also wondered if standing desks are good for your back. But, at this point, I was done researching. It was time for self-experimentation. 

My Standing Desk Results

At this point, the question “Should I get a standing desk?” was no brainer. I started using DIY standing desks immediately. On day one, after standing for 4 hours in total, I was a believer.

Having a standing desk immediately injected more movement into my day. Since I was on my feet, I started pacing during phone calls. I was more productive that day because I had more energy.

I still didn’t own a standing desk. Instead, I was finding creative ways to stand and work. In my opinion, the best way to start is with a DIY standing desk. 

In hotel rooms at night, I placed the ironing board on the bed and adjusted the height so that I could stand and work. This was my favorite DIY standing desk trick. The ironing board at home also turned into a standing desk. 

During the day when I was driving, I would take breaks and fire off some emails from the trunk. Again, I found this to be far more productive than sitting in the comfort of the driver’s seat.

Also, if you’re wondering, that is a 4″ thick Texas Manufacturer’s Directory. I am old school like that.  

Within days, my hip flexors loosened up, and my lower back pain from driving subsided. Within weeks, I was noticing tasks fall off my Evernote to-do list more quickly. The increased standing even helped me improve my sleep.

In the excitement of my standing desk discovery, I recommended them to everyone I met. Alex was already hooked and making the same recommendations.

Quick side-note on back pain. Since I have had (and still have) my fair share of back pain flare-ups, undoubtedly, a standing desk will help you. But make sure you also have a quality mattress as this is another significant cause of back pain.

Yoga has also reduced my back pain flare-ups. There are some incredible stretches listed in our couples yoga poses article. Grab your partner and give them a go!

In the years following, we did purchase multiple standing desks for use at home, in the office, and on the go.

So, YES. You should get a standing desk. And, in the rest of this article, we’ll share what we know about the dos and don’ts of using a standing desk. 

The Dos And Don’ts Of Standing Desks

So, “Should I get a standing desk?” you ask? YES. Freaking YES!

You should get a standing desk. But there is a lot to consider before investing in a standing desk. Plus, if you don’t do it right, you can hurt yourself.

Standing desks can be a significant investment. Or, they can be cheap, or even free if you use our DIY ironing board standing desk. It’s your choice.

Additionally, the options are endless since standing desks are the biggest trend in office furniture since the 1960’s cubicles. Companies with standing desks are up from 13% in 2013 to 44% in 2017, as reported by the Star Tribune.

We’ve helped a lot of our clients transition to standing desks, and it’s not uncommon to hear reports of temporary back or knee pain. You must listen to your body. There is a study that found too much standing (2+ hours at a time) can be harmful. 

On top of that, more companies are on board with purchasing standing desks for their employees to improve engagement, health, productivity, and recruitment. You can even request a standing desk doctor’s note to show your company that you’re motivated to make a healthy change.

Next, let’s talk about the dos and don’ts of incorporating a standing desk into your routine. 

1. What Standing Desk Should I Get?
Dos:

There are two popular options: an adjustable desk or a stationary desk. My Safco fixed-height standing desk is a perfect size. It was the most quality and cheap standing desk I could find.

The height is adjustable, but not quickly. However, this was fine for me. Since I worked from home, there were places to sit if I got tired of standing. I highly recommend this desk, especially if it’s for your home office. 

For Alex, her office didn’t have other places to sit, so she opted for her adjustable Versadesk tabletop desk. Her desk used a motor to change, at the press of a button, to a sitting position within seconds.

Very quality, but more expensive than my standing desk. If you’re working in an office, we highly recommend this standing desk. Be sure to request a standing desk doctor’s note and ask your company to pay.

Alex’s height-adjustable desk of her office.
Don’ts:

Don’t buy a non-adjustable desk converter (aka a small tabletop that props up your computer on your current desk.) The cheaper ones are too small to fit two monitors, are wobbly, and have height adjustment limitations.

Alex bought one of these to “start” and “save money.” But, she promptly returned it because it was uncomfortable, unstable, and didn’t have space for her keyboard.

Speaking of keyboards, many standing desks come with a keyboard shelf set a few inches below the desk height. We don’t think these are necessary as long as you adjust your monitor height accordingly.

Finally, make sure the desk is big enough. You don’t want to feel cramped at your desk, and you need space for a glass of water. Or, better yet, a gallon of water as a tool to keep you productive during the workday.

2. How High Should A Standing Desk Be?
Dos:

A proper standing desk posture is critical. Therefore, you need to get this right and take measurements before you make purchases.

The proper height for your standing desk is one inch below elbow height. Stand up straight and relax your shoulders when taking this measurement.

You want the height of your keyboard at a 90-degree angle with your elbows. Then, standing with a straight back and neck, you should be eye level with your screen about 3″ from the top. The screen tilt should be around 20 degrees away from you.

So, now that you know what to do to achieve proper standing desk posture, here’s what not to do. 

Don’ts:

Don’t do this halfway. Sure, sometimes my posture isn’t perfect with my DIY standing desks of stacked furniture or ironing boards. In this case, I feel the benefits of standing outweigh the consequences of less than perfect standing desk posture.

When you invest in a standing desk, do it right. If you buy a standing desk but don’t have a way to get your monitor at eye level, your back pain will transfer to your neck.

Proper posture is especially hard if you’re using a laptop, since the screen and keyboard are attached. For me, this meant buying a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard so that my laptop could be at eye level.

We’ll get more into our recommended standing desk tools at the end of this post. First, here’s some essential reading on how to transition from a sitting to a standing desk. 

Our current stacked furniture DIY standing desk in Mexico.

3. Transitioning To Your Standing Desk
Dos:

As I said before, listen to your body. Do transition to your new standing desk slowly. I only started working at my standing desk like a flamingo (in standing tree pose) after years of experience.

When you first start working at a standing desk, it’s a bad idea to go from 8 hours of sitting to 8 hours of standing cold turkey. We recommend switching hourly to begin, or else you’re at risk of pain and swelling in your back and lower body.

Also, you MUST use some type of padding below your feet. We have used this anti-fatigue mat, which worked well. In my home office, the resident interior design expert (Alex) bought me this memory foam bath mat, which worked and matched our decor.

Now that we are working remotely as a couple, and living out of suitcases, we stand on our yoga mats or wear comfortable shoes. Extra padding and sitting breaks make the transition pain free.

I worked my way to a full 8 hours a day of standing while Alex took breaks to sit during lunch and her 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM daily snacks.

Don’ts:

Some people read that a standing desk can cause injury and decide, “Well, I guess I shouldn’t get a standing desk.” A silly conclusion if you ask me.

You wouldn’t buy new running shoes and expect to be able to run a marathon pain-free the next day. Transitioning to a standing desk is like training for a marathon. It takes time.

Again, don’t rush it and listen to your body. The pros of using a standing desk far outweigh the cons. At the very least, commit to trialing a standing desk for a week and journal about your experience. 

If it’s positive, keep standing. If not, find other ways to add more activity into your day. 

4. Get Your Company To Pay For It
Dos:

As long as you present a good case, most companies won’t hesitate to pay for your standing desk or offer a significant subsidy. To create your case, refer to these studies showing increased productivity and health benefits.

Bosses want happy employees and will invest in you. You never know until you ask, even if you’re the first in your office! Remember, it’s possible to get a doctor’s note for a standing desk to strengthen your case. 

Once you have your company sold on standing desks, why not ask them if you can work from home for a day or two each week. For the benefits of remote work, read the book Remote: Office Not Required.

“Days spent sitting for hours may increase your risk for an early death no matter how much you exercise, researchers say.”

– Steven Reinberg of CBS News

Don’ts:

Don’t just ask your boss once and don’t tell them that it’s something you want. Be persistent and explain that it’s something that you need. What’s more, is they should be thankful that you want to set an excellent example in your workplace.

If your initial request is denied, ask a second and third time. If that’s unsuccessful, go to your boss’s boss and the company HR Manager. I used this tactic countless times, and it always worked.

Standing Desk Gear Recommendations

Here is a list of the standing desk gear that we have used and loved over the last 6 years. We also recently started wearing the UPRIGHT GO 2 posture trainers while working at our sitting and standing desks. 

After running a 2-week experiment to test the wearable posture corrector, our results were significant. We now use them daily while working on our laptops. You can see our transformation in our data-driven UPRIGHT GO 2 Review. 

Our favorite desks:
Stationary standing desk for working at home (cheap and simple but quality)
Height-adjustable desk riser for an office (hopefully a company expense)
Awesome, compact laptop stand we use for travel (perfect for coworking spaces or coffee shops
Anti-fatigue mats:
Memory foam mat (for the less industrial look at home)
Industrial anti-fatigue mat (the safest choice)
A travel yoga mat (a high quality, eco-friendly, multi-use option)
Laptop standing desk tools:
Apple mouse and keyboard
Laptop stand (the one we use for travel)
Active lifestyle wearables:
The Mi Band Fitness Tracker that we used it for years. It tracks steps, calories, and sleep very well and maintains an 8-day plus battery life.
Our upgraded Apple Watch Series 3 (38mm) for her and Apple Watch Series 3 (42mm) for him. We love the reminders to move and stand. The Activity Tracker motivates you to exercise, run, walk, or take the stairs more regularly.

If you have a FitBit or Apple Watch, check out our 30-Day Weight Loss Challenge. You’ll learn how to track your calories accurately, and in addition to tracking steps, you only have to track four other numbers critical to weight loss.

hey can, at times, look somewhat sinister, their faces oddly small for their heads, their white ear tufts jutting out almost aggressively. Their ability to throw themselves at people across seemingly unfeasible distances can be unsettling, and their buzzing and shrieking takes a lot of getting used to, as does their smell. But the members of the Caird collective will not hear a word spoken against the marmosets with whom they share their spaces at the Moon’s South Pole. As they sit in their insulated caves hoovering moondust out of the animals’ tails, few of the Cairders can imagine their life on the rim of Shackleton crater without them—and none wants to. The marmosets of the Moon are the first and best example of what has turned out to be a fundamental fact of space flight: that the further humans get from Earth, the more they benefit from the companionship of other Earthly animals.

A New Tool Shows How Google Results Vary Around the World
Search Atlas displays three sets of links—or images—from different countries for any search.
ILLUSTRATION: HIROSHI WATANABE

GOOGLE’S CLAIM TO “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful” has earned it an aura of objectivity. Its dominance in search, and the disappearance of most competitors, make its lists of links appear still more canonical. An experimental new interface for Google Search aims to remove that mantle of neutrality.

Search Atlas makes it easy to see how Google offers different responses to the same query on versions of its search engine offered in different parts of the world. The research project reveals how Google’s service can reflect or amplify cultural differences or government preferences—such as whether Beijing’s Tiananmen Square should be seen first as a sunny tourist attraction or the site of a lethal military crackdown on protesters.

Divergent results like that show how the idea of search engines as neutral is a myth, says Rodrigo Ochigame, a PhD student in science, technology, and society at MIT and cocreator of Search Atlas. “Any attempt to quantify relevance necessarily encodes moral and political priorities,” Ochigame says.

Ochigame built Search Atlas with Katherine Ye, a computer science PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University and a research fellow at the nonprofit Center for Arts, Design, and Social Research.

Just like Google’s homepage, the main feature of Search Atlas is a blank box. But instead of returning a single column of results, the site displays three lists of links, from different geographic versions of Google Search selected from the more than 100 the company offers. Search Atlas automatically translates a query to the default languages of each localized edition using Google Translate.

Ochigame and Ye say the design reveals “information borders” created by the way Google’s search technology ranks web pages, presenting different slices of reality to people in different locations or using different languages.

When they used their tool to do an image search on “Tiananmen Square,” the UK and Singaporean versions of Google returned images of tanks and soldiers quashing the 1989 student protests. When the same query was sent to a version of Google tuned for searches from China, which can be accessed by circumventing the country’s Great Firewall, the results showed recent, sunny images of the square, smattered with tourists.

Google’s search engine has been blocked in China since 2010, when the company said it would stop censoring topics the government deemed sensitive, such as the Tiananmen massacre. Search Atlas suggests that the China edition of the company’s search engine can reflect the Chinese government’s preferences all the same. That pattern could result in part from how the corpus of web pages from any language or region would reflect cultural priorities and pressures.

An experimental interface for Google Search found that it offered very different views of Beijing's Tiananmen Square to searchers from the UK (left), Singapore (center), and China. COURTESY OF SEARCH ATLAS

A Google spokesperson said the differences in results were not caused by censorship and that content about the Tiananmen Square massacre is available via Google Search in any language or locale setting. Touristy images win prominence in some cases, the spokesperson said, when the search engine detects an intent to travel, which is more likely for searchers closer to Beijing or typed in Chinese. Searching for Tiananmen Square from Thailand or the US using Google’s Chinese language setting also prompts recent, clean images of the historic site.

“We localize results to your preferred region and language so you can quickly access the most reliable information,” the spokesperson said. Google users can tune their own results by adjusting their location setting and language.

The Search Atlas collaborators also built maps and visualizations showing how search results can differ around the globe. One shows how searching for images of “God” yields bearded Christian imagery in Europe and the Americas, images of Buddha in some Asian countries, and Arabic script for Allah in the Persian Gulf and northeast Africa. The Google spokesperson said the results reflect how its translation service converts the English term “God” into words with more specific meanings for some languages, such as Allah in Arabic.

Other information borders charted by the researchers don’t map straightforwardly onto national or language boundaries. Results for “how to combat climate change” tend to divide island nations and countries on continents. In European countries such as Germany, the most common words in Google’s results related to policy measures such as energy conservation and international accords; for islands such as Mauritius and the Philippines, results were more likely to cite the enormity and immediacy of the threat of a changing climate, or harms such as sea level rise.

Search Atlas was presented last month at the academic conference Designing Interactive Systems; its creators are testing a private beta of the service and considering how to widen access to it.

Search Atlas can’t reveal why different versions of Google portray the world differently. The company’s lucrative ranking systems are closely held, and the company says little about how it tunes results based on geography, language, or a person’s activity.

Whatever the exact reason Google shows—or doesn’t show—particular results, they have a power too easily overlooked, says Search Atlas cocreator Ye. “People ask search engines things they would never ask a person, and the things they happen to see in Google’s results can change their lives,” Ye says. “It could be ‘How do I get an abortion?’ restaurants near you, or how you vote, or get a vaccine.”

WIRED’s own experiments showed how people in neighboring countries could be steered by Google to very different information on a hot topic. When WIRED queried Search Atlas about the ongoing war in Ethiopia’s Tigray region, Google’s Ethiopia edition pointed to Facebook pages and blogs that criticized Western diplomatic pressure to deescalate the conflict, suggesting that the US and others were trying to weaken Ethiopia. Results for neighboring Kenya, and the US version of Google, more prominently featured explanatory news coverage from sources such as the BBC and The New York Times.

Ochigame and Ye are not the first to point out that search engines aren’t neutral actors. Their project was partly inspired by the work of Safiya Noble, cofounder and codirector of UCLA’s Center for Critical Internet Inquiry. Her 2018 book Algorithms of Oppression explored how Google searches using words such as “Black” or “Hispanic” produced results reflecting and reinforcing societal biases against certain marginalized people.

Noble says the project could provide a way to explain the true nature of search engines to a broader audience. “It’s very difficult to make visible the ways search engines are not democratic,” she says.

Web search can feel like vintage technology, but Noble says spotlighting its intricacies is as important as ever because of Google’s dominance and the way attention to social media’s skews can make search look benign by comparison.

Google is unlikely to lose its grip on the search market any time soon, but Noble sees reasons for optimism. The growing user base of the privacy-centric search company DuckDuckGo suggests that some netizens are open to alternatives. Noble sees growing interest from policymakers and the public in regulating tech platforms more tightly, and in finding ways to support alternatives that better serve the public interest. “We have a community of scholars calling for that, in dialog with foundations and governments,” she says.

President Biden wants to spend tens of billions of dollars on transmission lines to transport renewable electricity across states, which he says will improve grid reliability. His climate model of California is showing the limits and risks of this strategy.

California’s Independent System Operator (Caiso) on Friday and Saturday issued emergency alerts urging residents to conserve power during the evenings to avoid rolling blackouts. A wildfire in Oregon threatened transmission lines that import thousands of megawatts of hydropower that are needed when the sun starts to go down.

Progressives blamed Texas’s power outage in February on its limited ability to import power from other states after its wind turbines froze and not enough natural gas plants could ramp up to compensate. But grids in neighboring states had little power to spare, which was the problem this weekend in California and will continue to be all summer.

The California Public Utilities Commission ordered Caiso last month to procure more power for evening hours this summer due to reduced hydropower generation and imports caused by drought. It’s not clear where Caiso plans to get the power since supply is expected to be tight across the Western U.S. for the same reasons.

Rest assured, Caiso has a back-up plan: Snatch energy headed elsewhere. Caiso manages interconnections between utilities and power providers across the Western U.S. For instance, Arizona utilities contract with hydropower plants in the Northwest for power that is transmitted through California.

The Cherished Tradition of Scrapbooking
Author Jessica Helfand investigates the history of scrapbooks and how they mirror American history

Graphic designer Jessica Helfand has been fascinated with visual biography since her days as a graduate student in the late 1980s, pouring over Ezra Pound’s letters and photographs in Yale’s rare book library. But the “incendiary moment,” as she calls it, which really sparked her interest in scrapbooks came in 2005, when she wrote critically of the hobby on her blog Design Observer. Helfand derided contemporary scrapbookers as “people whose concept of innovation is measured by novel ways to tie bows,” among other things, and was vilified by the craft’s enthusiasts. “I hit a nerve,” she says.

Spurred on by the rise of scrapbooking as the fastest growing American hobby, Helfand set out to study the medium, collecting, from antique stores and eBay auctions, over 200 scrapbooks dating from the beginning of the nineteenth century to the present. In the collages of fabric swatches, locks of hair, calling cards and even cigarette butts pasted on their pages, she found real artistry. Helfand’s latest book, Scrapbooks: An American History, tells the story of how personal histories, as told through the scrapbooks of civilians and celebrities, including writers Zelda Fitzgerald, Lillian Hellman, Anne Sexton and Hilda Doolittle, combine to tell American history.

What types of scrapbooks do you find the most interesting?

The more eclectic. The more insane. Scrapbooks that are pictures of just babies and cherubs or just clippings from the newspaper tend to interest me less. I like when they’re chaotic the way life is.

What are some of the strangest things you’ve seen saved in them?

Apparently it was custom in the Victorian age for people to keep scrapbooks just of obituaries. And they are weird obituaries, like one in which a woman watches in horror as streetcar claims the life of her six children. Incredibly macabre, gruesome things. We have one of these books from 1894 in Ohio, and in it there is every weird obituary. “Woman lives with remains of daughter for two weeks in a farmhouse before she’s discovered.” Just one after another, and it’s pasted onto the pages of a geometry textbook.

You see often in books by college and high school girls these bizarre juxtapositions, like a picture of Rudy Valentino next to a church prayer card, or a box of Barnum’s animal crackers pasted right next to some steamy, embraced Hollywood couple for some movie that had just come out. You could see the tension in trying to figure out who they were and what their identities were vis-à-vis these emblems of religious and popular culture. I’m a kid, but I really want to be a grownup. There’s something so dear about it.

What do you think goes through people’s minds as they paste things?

In antebellum culture just after the Civil War, there was this kind of carpe diem quality that pervaded American life. I have my own theory that one of the reasons for the rise in scrapbooking has been so meteoric since 9/11 is precisely that. People keep scrapbooks and diaries more during wartime and after wartime, and famine and disease and fear. When you feel an increased sense of vulnerability, what can you do to steel yourself against the inevitable tide of human suffering but to paste something in a book? It seems silly, but on the other hand, it’s quite logical.

Scrapbooks, like diaries, can get pretty personal. Did you ever feel like you were snooping?

I took pains not to be prurient. These people aren’t here to speak for themselves anymore. It was very humbling to me to think about the people who made these things in the moments that they made them, what they were thinking, their fears and trepidations. The Lindbergh kidnapping, the Hindenburg, all these things were happening, and they were trying to make sense of it. You fall in love with these people. You can’t have emotional distance. I wanted to have some analytical distance in terms of the composition of the books, but certainly when it comes to the emotional truths that these people were living with day by day, the best I could do was just be an ambassador for their stories.

How do scrapbooks of famous and non-famous people slip through the cracks and not end up with their families?

The reason scrapbooks secede from their families is that there are typically not children to keep them. Or it’s because the kids didn’t care. They’re old, falling apart. To a lot of people, they’re really forgettable. To me, they’re treasures.

But the other thing is the more curatorial, scholarly angle. There tends to be a very scientific, quantitative view of gathering evidence and then telling the story chronologically. These things just fly in the face of that logic. People picked them up, put them down, started over, ripped out pages. They’re so unwieldy. Typically historians are more methodical and meticulous in their research and in their compilation of stories. These things are the opposite, and so they were relegated to the bottom of the pile. They would just be anecdotally referenced, but certainly not held in point as really reliable historical documents. My editor tells me that there’s a more open mindedness to that kind of first person history today, so I may have written this book at a time when it could be accepted on some scholarly level in a way that it couldn’t have 20 years before.

   
Wooden Spoon. Enloe Scrapbook, 1922. (Scrapbooks: An American History / Yale University Press)

What was it like paging through poet Anne Sexton’s scrapbook for first time, seeing the key to the hotel room where she spent her wedding night?

It’s the most adorable, clumsy, newly wed, young, silly thing. It’s just not what you associate with her. Those kinds of moments were certainly exciting for me in terms of finding something I didn’t expect to find that was so out of sync with what the record books tell us. It was sort of like finding a little treasure, like you were going through your grandmother’s drawers and you found a stack of love letters from a man who wasn’t your grandfather. It had that kind of quality of discovery. I loved, for example, the little firecrackers from a fourth of July party and the apology note from the first marital spat she had with her husband, the goofy handwriting, the Campbell soup recipes, things that were very much a part of 1949-1951. They become such portals into social, economic and material culture history.

In your book, you describe how scrapbooking has evolved. Preformatted memory books, like baby and wedding books, were more about documenting. And scrapbooking today is more about purchasing materials than using vestigial ones. Why the shift?

It shows that there is an economic incentive. If you see that there is a trend that something is happening you want to jump on the bandwagon and be part of it. My guess is that some very savvy publishers in the 1930s, ‘40s and ‘50s said they were going to make memory books that told you what to remember. That to me is very interesting because it shaped the way we started to value certain memories over others. It was good and bad; they were doing what Facebook does for us now. Facebook will change the way we think about sharing pictures and stories about our mundane lives the same way those publishers made those books and told you to save the fingerprints of your babies.

You’ve been quite vocal and critical about contemporary scrapbooking, and yet you haven’t called it “crapbooking,” as other graphic designers have. Where do you stand?

What I’ve been trying to advocate is that it’s an extremely authentic form of storytelling. You just save something, reflect on it, put it next to something else and suddenly there’s a story instead of the story being sanctioned by pink ribbons and matching paper. I don’t say don’t go to the store and buy pretty stuff. But my fear is that a certain monotony will come out of our reliance on merchandise. How is it possible that all our scrapbooks will be beautiful because they look like Martha Stewart’s, when are lives are all so incredibly different? With so much reliance on the “stuff” a certain authenticity is lost. I kept seeing this expression of “getting it right,” women wanting to “get it right.” Everybody made scrapbooks a hundred years ago, and people didn’t worry about getting it right. They just made things, and they were messy, incomplete and inconsistent. To me, the real therapeutic act is being who you are. You stop and you think what was my day. I planted seeds. I went to the store. Maybe it’s really mundane but that’s who you are, and maybe if you think about it, save it and look at it, you’ll find some truth in that that’s actually very rewarding. It’s a very forgiving canvas, the scrapbook.

As journalists, we’re all wondering whether the print newspaper and magazine will survive the digital age. Do you think the tangible scrapbook will survive in the advent of digital cameras, blogs and Facebook?

I hope they won’t disappear. I personally think there is nothing that replaces the tactile—the way they smell, the way they look, the dried flowers. There’s just something really amazing about seeing a fabric sample from 1921 in a book when you haven’t ever seen a piece of fabric that color before. There’s a certain recognition about yourself and about your world when you see something that no longer exists. When it’s on the screen, it’s a little less of that immersive experience. At the same time, if there is a way to keep scrapbooking relevant, move it forward, make it be a satellite of its former self and move into some new zone and become something else, then that’s a progressive way of thinking about it moving into the next generation.

The Robinhood Conundrum

Posted July 6, 2021 by Ben Carlson

Last week Robinhood filed their S-1 to register for an IPO.

Here’s the good and bad of it:

This seems good: Robinhood now has close to 18 million active users on its platform and manages around $80 billion in assets. More than half of those 18 million customers said this was their first-ever brokerage account.

And Robinhood believes close to 50% of all new retail funded accounts opened in the U.S. between 2016 and 2021 were done so on its platform.

Robinhood has gotten millions of young people involved in the markets.

This seems bad: Nearly 47% of those users use the product on a daily basis. That’s basically just below the most successful social media companies.

Among those customers who visted the app on a daily basis, the average number of visits was seven per day.

There’s an old saying that successful investing should be like watching paint dry. I’m not exactly sure you’re supposed to check the dryness of the paint that many times a day.

More than 98% of users use the app on a monthly basis.

This type of engagement and usage is insanely high for an investment product.

This seems good: Robinhood’s customer growth numbers are off the charts in the past 15 months:

There are many reasons for this but people have decided they are now interested in the markets in a big way.

This seems bad: This growth is coming at a cost. Robinhood just paid a $70 million fine to FINRA for outages and misleading their clients, the largest such fine ever enforced.

The company is also subject to 15 putative class action lawsuits at the moment. I would expect that number to grow in the years ahead as their growth outstrips the company’s ability to deal with problems.

This seems good: Robinhood estimates they provided customers $1.5 billion in price improvements and saved as much as $1.6 billion in crypto transaction fees from January 2020 through March 2021.

Thank you free commissions.

This seems bad: Robinhood is making a lot of money on its customer assets. They made $959 million in total revenue in 2020 (up from $278 million in 2019). In the first quarter alone they made $522 million (up from $128 million in Q1 2020).

It’s good for business if Robinhood’s customers trade more and pay higher spreads. This was a risk factor listed in the S-1:

Because a majority of our revenue is transaction-based (including payment for order flow, or “PFOF”), reduced spreads in securities pricing, reduced levels of trading activity generally, changes in our business relationships with market makers and any new regulation of, or any bans on, PFOF and similar practices may result in reduced profitability, increased compliance costs and expanded potential for negative publicity.

The more you trade, the more they make.

Typically, the more people trade, the less they keep.

This seems good: Professional investors keep proclaiming “this won’t end well” but so far Robinhood customers are doing just fine for themselves. Robinhood estimates customers have seen appreciation of $25 billion on their assets through the end of March 2021.

That’s not bad considering there is $80 billion on the platform.

This seems bad: Robinhood is making a lot of money on options. Here is the breakdown for revenues by asset:

Although options make up less than 3% of assets on the platform, they accounted for 47% of transaction-based revenues in 2020 and 38% of transaction-based revenues in the first 3 months of this year.

They are making a killing on options. Never say never, but I’m guessing most of their customers won’t be able to say the same thing over the long haul.

This seems good: When the stock comes public (under the ticker HOOD), 20-35% of shares will be allocated to Robinhood customers. This is a win for the democratization of investing narrative they are playing up.

I’m glad they’re doing this.

This seems bad: This was another risk factor listed in the S-1:

Our customers may be able to purchase shares of our Class A common stock offered by this prospectus from RHF, acting in its capacity as a selling group member in this offering. Any negative experiences our customers have in connection with their participation or attempted participation in this offering may harm our brand and reputation, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our customers’ participation in this offering could result in increased volatility in the trading price of our Class A common stock.

Basically, if Robinhood messes this up it could present a risk for their stock price. And since Robinhood customers trade a lot it could add volatility to HOOD shares.

Bizarrely, this volatility would actually help Robinhood’s bottom line. Moving on.

This seems good: Robinhood has around $5.4 billion in margin for their clients. That’s less than 7% of total assets, far lower than I would have thought based around the idea that traders generously apply leverage in their portfolios these days.

This seems bad: Dogecoin, the meme cryptocurrency, was actually listed as a risk factor by the company:

A substantial portion of the recent growth in our net revenues earned from cryptocurrency transactions is attributable to transactions in Dogecoin. If demand for transactions in Dogecoin declines and is not replaced by new demand for other cryptocurrencies available for trading on our platform, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Ugh.

Robinhood also noted clients held approximately $12 billion in crypto assets yet in the first quarter of 2021, $88 billion of crypto was traded on the platform. That’s an enormous turnover number.

This probably says as much about crypto investors as it does Robinhood clients but that’s not necessarily a good thing.

This seems inevitable: It appears trading on your smartphone is here to stay:

We observe a similar trend in the equity markets, where 30% of retail investors in the United States place orders using a mobile app, according to 2018 FINRA surveys. That number grows to 59% when looking solely at participants aged 18-34. Innovative technology-based companies are challenging traditional norms and engaging people in new ways.

I have mixed emotions about these stats and Robinhood in general.

I am a customer at Robinhood. They do legitimately have one of the best user experiences of any finance company around. It’s so easy and intuitive to use.

But I’m a long-term investor so I don’t use it all that often. I’m not speculating on dog coins or YOLOing options.

Most things in life are about trade-offs.

It’s a wonderful thing Robinhood has gotten so many new speculators investors involved in the markets. And the company single-handedly forced every other brokerage into lowering commissions to zero.

However, people always drink more at an open bar.

Robinhood isn’t forcing anyone to trade options or crypto or stocks all the time. People can make their own choices.

I do worry that Robinhood’s business model is incentivized to nudge their customers into reckless trading strategies that will make the company more money.

Just because you can trade for free doesn’t mean investing should be a free-for-all.

Either way, Robinhood is now a massive company that is only going to get bigger.

Jordan’s government used secretly recorded Clubhouse audio to spread disinformation
A new Stanford report says content from the app was used as part of a wider state-sponsored propaganda campaign.

12 JULY 2021

When Clubhouse started taking off earlier this year, some users worried that sensitive conversations on the social audio app might be secretly recorded for nefarious purposes. In places like Saudi Arabia and Hong Kong, people were increasingly using Clubhouse to discuss taboo political topics, sparking concerns that authorities could be listening in. Now, researchers say that fear has come true. 

In a new report released last week by The Stanford Internet Observatory, researchers analyzed a Jordanian disinformation network that pushed pro-monarchy and pro-military narratives on Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok. The campaign, which Facebook said in a separate report had links to the Jordanian military, also republished audio that had been secretly recorded on Clubhouse. Researchers said this is the first time they have identified a disinformation operation that relied on Clubhouse and TikTok, indicating that some states are taking advantage of newer platforms to spread propaganda.

The Jordanian campaign cobbled together audio and screen recordings from Clubhouse into at least one video that was then shared on Facebook. According to the report, the audio was taken from a conversation in which Jordanians outside the country and other Arab voices discussed Prince Hamzah, the half-brother of Jordan’s leader, King Abdullah II, who was taken into custody in early April, along with over a dozen other prominent figures. Jordanian authorities accused Hamzah of plotting to destabilize the government, and while the prince later publicly pledged his loyalty to the king, he currently remains on house arrest. 

Jordan is home to more than 10 million people and has been ruled by King Abudullah II since 1999.

People who saw the video “didn’t know that it was linked to individuals in the Jordanian military,” said Shelby Grossman, a research scholar at the Internet Observatory and a co-author of the report. “But at the same time, you could imagine that if someone watched this video, they might think to themselves, ‘Oh, people are listening when you have these Clubhouse conversations.’” 

While Clubhouse has not been officially banned by the Jordanian government, the nonprofit Jordan Open Source Association found that the app can currently only be accessed using a VPN.

Recording is against Clubhouse’s Terms of Service, which prohibits users from capturing “any portion of a conversation without the expressed consent of all of the speakers involved.” The company did not respond to a request for comment about how it enforces the rule. A number of other Clubhouse conversations have previously been recorded and leaked to the public. 

Sam Gregory, the program director at Witness, a nonprofit that helps people use video and other technology to promote human rights, said that audio can be a particularly powerful medium for disinformation because it lacks many of the context clues found in videos or photos, which makes it hard to tell where a clip may have originated or whether it’s been manipulated. “The orientation of Clubhouse is people talking, often for longer periods of time in conversational contexts,” said Gregory. “You have access to more raw material that you might mis-contextualize or edit.”

While this is the first time Clubhouse has been implicated, other forms of audio disinformation have been identified in other countries, particularly on messaging apps with voice note features like WhatsApp. During the aftermath of a major earthquake in 2017 in Mexico, viral audio messages spread false rumors that survivors trapped in collapsed buildings had been abandoned by the government. In Brazil, an audio clip from someone claiming to be a doctor discouraged people from getting the yellow fever vaccine during an outbreak in 2018. First Draft News, an organization that studies misinformation online, also identified a number of false audio clips circulating ahead of the country’s presidential election the same year.

The most extensive portion of the Jordanian disinformation network was on Facebook. The social network said in its report that it had removed over 100 Facebook and Instagram accounts, three groups, and 35 pages connected to the campaign, four of which had more than 80,000 followers. The effort also included around $26,000 worth of Facebook ads, but it’s unclear exactly whom they may have targeted. A spokesperson for Facebook said that the company’s Ad Library transparency tool doesn’t currently include data on ads that were run previously in Jordan.

The Stanford researchers also identified a handful of sock puppet accounts on TikTok that appeared to have ties to the same network. “They clearly did not put a lot of effort into it,” said Grossman, noting that the fake personalities didn’t post original content, instead sharing videos from established accounts associated with the Jordanian military. But Grossman also cautioned that the platform is less accessible to researchers than Facebook. “There could be lots of this on TikTok that just hasn’t been found, or that TikTok has found, suspended, and just not disclosed,” she said. 

TikTok did not respond to a request for comment about how the company handles state-sponsored disinformation on its platform.

Though many of the accounts identified by Facebook and the Internet Observatory were created in 2020 or earlier, they became particularly active after the arrest of Prince Hamzah and other officials in April. As the royal drama unfolded, authorities imposed a media blackout that prevented news outlets from covering the prince’s arrest. “We saw a spike in posting on the Facebook network during this blackout,” said Grossman. “One possible interpretation is that they wanted to fill the void in social media discussion with pro-government content.”

While the Jordanian disinformation campaign was relatively unsophisticated, researchers say its use of new platforms is noteworthy — and a sign of what’s to come. “We were able to see them dipping their toes into these emerging technologies,” said Grossman. “I don’t think this will be the last that we’ll see Clubhouse audio being used or TikTok accounts being used.”

Tiger vs. SoftBank: Inside the investing playbooks that upended Silicon Valley

The two firms invested the most money into startups so far in 2021. But how they do it is completely different.

Biz Carson  July 12, 2021

Nylas CEO Gleb Polyakov had been following the Silicon Valley playbook for raising money: meet with firms; deal with associates, then partners; and try to clinch funding for his developer-tools startup.

Then Tiger Global handed over a term sheet.

When Polyakov alerted other firms interested in investing in his hot API maker to Tiger's offer, one of the more traditional firms he had been talking to abandoned the deal. There's an "old boys' club" and a "process" Silicon Valley VC firms like to follow, said Polyakov. "And if you don't follow the process they get very upset and very insulted, which seems a little silly."

The last firm to turn the tables on Sand Hill Road before Tiger was SoftBank. The Japanese conglomerate had raised a $100 billion fund to invest in tech startups, and its "capital cannon," as Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi called it, became a thing entrepreneurs wanted behind them in support, not facing them as a threat. The investment strategy set off an arms race of firms raising larger and larger growth funds to compete in deals.

Now in 2021, there's been an explosion in venture capital investment as all that cash has sought places to land. The first half of 2021 shattered records with $288 billion invested in startups globally.

Leading the pack is Tiger Global Management, which has emerged as this year's funding jockey, setting a blistering pace with venture firms racing to keep up. Tiger Global has invested in over 120 startups already this year, according to an analysis by PitchBook for Protocol, and shows no signs of slowing down with a $6.7 billion fund announced in April and a rumored $10 billion fund on its heels.

"Their strategy right now seems to be hinging a lot on 'Money is still cheap.' The public markets are still accepting these unicorns and VC-backed companies and sustaining those high valuations that they're seeing in the private markets," said PitchBook analyst Kyle Stanford. "Sometime last year [Tiger Global] saw the opportunity to just put as much money to work in the market right now as they can, and that's what they did."

SoftBank, meanwhile, has returned to the market after the WeWork deal's fallout cooled outside investors' interest in its Vision Fund 2. The firm rebounded after mega-hits like Coupang and DoorDash, and is now as much of a player as when it first shook up the venture capital world. SoftBank recently upped the size of Vision Fund 2 to $30 billion of its own money and has made 90 investments from the fund.

Tiger Global and SoftBank are now the two largest investors when it comes to dollars invested in startups for 2021. But the approach to how the two deploy capital is incredibly different.

Kings and nerds

SoftBank is a kingmaker, led by internet emperor Masayoshi "Masa" Son. All of the investments involve a pitch to the chief of SoftBank, who is said to back founders who inspire him and reward CEOs who have the biggest, most audacious plans.

Tiger Global doesn't have the same kind of frontman. Don't try Googling it: Its website presents all of three pages to the public internet, hiding the rest for investors. It prefers to stay out of the press. Instead, it's known for studying its prey and then pouncing on a deal. Its relentless speed is a result of having done much of the diligence on an investment before it even approaches a company. Once it's invested, it remains largely hands-off — a big contrast to SoftBank, which will take board seats and hasn't been afraid to switch up management when needed.

What they have in common — and what makes them both symbols of this golden age of venture investing — is being open-checkbook investors who aren't afraid of pouring hundreds of millions into a startup with a desire to hold that position into the public markets. As such, they've both shaken up the venture capital market in 2021 and are the new forces driving deal speed and price in late-stage investing.

Dot-com to domination


2001 was not an obvious time to start investing in technology companies amid the dot-com bust, but Tiger Global, then Tiger Technology, launched with a 25-year-old Chase Coleman III at the helm. Coleman was one of the "Tiger Cubs," the trusted protégés of Julian Robertson, the founder of Tiger Management.

The hedge fund began by investing in public equities in 2001 before quickly branching into private equity a few years later. Its key early bets were in Sina Corp, Sohu.com and NetEase, the "Yahoos of China," led by investor Scott Shleifer.

"We are grateful to have begun our investment careers at a time when the internet era was just beginning," the firm said in a letter marking its 20th anniversary this year. "Inexperience may have been an asset when it came to imagining what a new internet-connected world could look like, and our research indicated that market leaders could achieve very high returns on capital."

The fund amassed stakes in companies like Facebook, Amazon and Netflix, but then regretted selling the shares early, according to the letter. For a while, Tiger's tech investing was led by Lee Fixel, who made prescient bets on startups like Peloton and Stripe. But in 2019, Fixel left to start his own rival firm, Addition. Now the power trio at Tiger consists of Coleman, Shleifer and John Curtius.

The firm is notoriously press-shy, with Coleman described as a "reclusive billionaire" and the Tiger Global partners not willing to participate in media interviews. Curtius at least posts regularly on LinkedIn about how thrilled and excited he is when new investments are announced.

SoftBank, on the other hand, is well-known for being in the spotlight. The firm had grown from a software distributor founded by Son in the 1980s to a holding company that turned a $20 million bet in Alibaba into $50 billion. In 2016, Son appeared with then-President-elect Donald Trump in the gilded lobby of Trump Tower, pledging to bring jobs to the U.S. (It's a pledge he never showed that he'd met.) Within months, he announced the SoftBank Vision Fund — a $100 billion fund that made it the largest tech investor in the world.

Son's team has made headlines, too, for the wrong reasons. Vision Fund CEO Rajeev Misra was accused of sabotaging his internal rivals, allegations he denied. His second-in-command, COO Ruwan Weerasekera, retired late last year, and four partners left around the same time. Jeffrey Housenbold, a partner who led troubled investments in Brandless and Wag, announced his departure in January and recently launched a SPAC. (Housenbold was also responsible for the successful DoorDash deal.)

"SoftBank is a little bit like working with the Kardashians. They're famous for being famous," said Manny Medina, CEO of Outreach, a Seattle software firm that's now valued at $4.4 billion after raising a $200 million round in June from investors including Tiger Global. "They're in the news all the time, even for minor stuff. An investment goes up, they're in the news. An investment goes down, they're in the news. They get a disproportionate share of attention, which I think they love, to be frank."

Vision capital, not venture capital

The launch of the Vision Fund in 2017 was certainly headline-worthy. SoftBank had amassed $100 billion from backers like Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, Apple, Foxconn and Qualcomm to invest in the future via startups.

Nearly all of its transportation and proptech bets were part of the initial fund with marquee companies like Uber, DiDi and WeWork. It's since shifted tactics with Vision Fund 2, its new fund that's entirely backed by SoftBank's money. The firm is now writing smaller checks and, similar to Tiger, has moved to investing earlier in companies like leading a recent $100 million series B round in videoconferencing tool Mmhmm.

It's also invested more aggressively in health tech and ed tech startups, and it continues to invest in consumer-oriented companies like celebrity video startup Cameo.

"Venture capital seems too small for SoftBank. Vision capital is more like it," Son said recently.

Tiger Global of course isn't as publicly outspoken about its strategy, but its recent investing track record shows a bias toward enterprise and SaaS startups. (SoftBank's made 22 enterprise investments, with 14 being part of its most recent fund, according to its portfolio list.) Tiger advertises doing deals from series A and beyond, but it reportedly did a seed investment in income-sharing startup Blair in May. "[Tiger Global] obviously has been very aggressive investing a lot of money in creating somewhat of a venture capital index," said Stanford, the PitchBook analyst.

Setting the pace

Mention Tiger to a venture capitalist and the first thing they're going to talk about is how quickly the fund is doing deals.

Often, the quick speed at which the firm moves is interpreted as a lack of due diligence. It's become a favorite Twitter meme among venture capitalists to poke fun at Tiger's diligence process.

But Polyakov thinks outsiders are getting it wrong. Most of Tiger Global's diligence comes before it even approaches the company, he said.

First, its portfolio of 400 companies gives it tremendous insight into the market. Tiger partners don't need to take the steps of arranging customer interviews for diligence because a lot of their portfolio companies are already customers and they can lean on their experience, Polyakov pointed out. Second, Tiger employs an army of Bain consultants. As a result, Tiger doesn't have to do its homework on the fly; it's done it in advance.

SoftBank is also known for its speed, but that comes down more to the instincts and whims of its charismatic founder. Pitching Son directly has become part of the ritual of taking an investment and is a make-or-break moment for a pitch. In the weeks leading up to it, founders are coached on how he thinks and how his brain works so they can map the pitch to better suit him.

Ofer Bengal, the CEO of Redis Labs, found both Tiger and SoftBank vying for the lead in a new financing round just months after an August round had made his open-source database software startup a unicorn. The VCs he talked to were people he'd known for years — the classic Silicon Valley model of relationship-building. But this was his first time dealing with the new mega-financiers. A relationship that normally takes years to build was compressed to a few months. Or, in the case of SoftBank, less than half an hour when it came time to pitch the patriarch.

Bengal said his meeting with Son was booked for 30 or 45 minutes, but 20 minutes into it, Son had made up his mind and was interested in investing.

In the end, Tiger narrowly squeezed out SoftBank as the lead investor for the deal, but Redis Labs is a rare company to have both firms invest. Together the round included $110 million in primary investment and another $200 million in secondary share purchases. The round was for a small percentage of the company, which is now worth more than $2 billion.

"Both are aggressive on pace of deployment and how they look at valuation multiples, so there's not a lot of difference there," said one VC who co-invests with both firms frequently.

Adding value — or staying out of the way

SoftBank often takes one or more board seats as part of its investment. In the early days of SoftBank's Vision Fund, the firm was known for making aggressive investments and buying up large percentages of companies.

The result meant that SoftBank had a lot of influence in some of the companies and was prepared to wield it. The firm is largely seen as responsible for pushing out Brandless founder Tina Sharkey following its investment. The ecommerce startup ended up shutting down in February 2020. It also invested $300 million in dog-walking startup Wag and replaced its management before ultimately giving up its board seat and selling its stake back to the company for a loss.

But the aggressive-money approach also helped some of its marquee bets. The company invested $680 million over three years in DoorDash, which used the cash to help strengthen its position in the food-delivery wars. That stake turned into a gain of $11 billion for the firm at the time of its blockbuster IPO. It repeated the process with Coupang, which turned into a $33 billion "windfall" for the firm.

Where SoftBank does add a lot of value is in pushing founders to dream bigger and helping them go international. Startups often point to SoftBank's help in going global as a reason to take their money. Clearco's Michele Romanow cited that as a reason for taking SoftBank's money to TechCrunch after she raised $215 million for her firm, which helps other startups raise non-dilutive capital.

Tiger, on the other hand, is "proudly passive" as an investor, said a competing VC. The firm doesn't require a board seat to lead a deal and isn't very hands-on with its companies.

"They're very clear on what they don't do. They stay out of your hair, they don't take board seats, they're not going to tell you how to run your company," Outreach's Medina said. "They tell you, 'We're going to give you money, and we're going to make Bain available to you,' which is very expensive — that could be alone between half a million to a couple million dollars."

Polyakov's Nylas is one of the few companies where a Tiger Global investor actually joined the board — at Polyakov's request. It wasn't a part of the term sheet and there was a bit of a conversation around it, but having Curtius, Tiger's software-investing lead, join the board felt like a fit for Polyakov's ambitions for the company.

"The thing that really resonated with me was his transparency: He's straight to the point, he says what he means and you're able to say what you mean," Polyakov said of Curtius. "Conversations that would have taken an hour take 10 minutes."

A lot of what Silicon Valley investors offer is just "fluff," said Polyakov. In a survey of startups Polyakov referenced, founders ranked relationship, deal terms and speed as the three most important factors for making a deal. Operational support ranked second to last.

In a sign of the disconnect between founders and funders, VCs saw speed as the least important factor in making the deal.

"The rise of Tiger Global exposes an uncomfortable truth for VCs," Eniac Ventures co-founder Hadley Harris pointed out on Twitter. "That there's a good chunk of founders who just want to be left alone."

Hold on for one more day

One area where both Tiger and SoftBank are proving their value is holding onto shares. That practice is helping them edge some traditional VCs out of the later rounds because they can't hang onto a stake indefinitely, since they need to deliver proceeds back to their LPs.

Tiger is using a willingness to hold onto shares as a deal advantage, said Medina. In the case of Redis Labs, Tiger wanted provisions at the IPO to buy even more shares, said Bengal.

Bengal saw the investment from Tiger and SoftBank as his company's last round before an IPO. And if the markets tank? Both are investors that can afford to bail a company out. "I think we are on our journey to an IPO, but if worse comes to worst and the market changes and all these doomsday scenarios, these guys have deep pockets, so they're both great partners," Bengal said.

SoftBank and Tiger also have the advantage of having the experience in holding public equity. "SoftBank, they can hold on to that public equity as long as they want and realize it whenever it is best for them," said Stanford, the PitchBook analyst. "Tiger Global is also going to have a whole other side of their business to help manage that portfolio, where other VCs might need to hire an outside consulting firm to figure out how to deal with and manage their public equity."

Tiger Global may be setting the pace and the deal terms lately, but founders may be the real winners from its growing competitiveness with SoftBank. Instead of one ominous capital cannon, there are now two — both willing to move quickly to snag deals. And if VCs can't rethink their dealmaking traditions, they may find themselves caught in the crossfire.

Stop winging it: Business communications has become even smarter than you think
Anthony Bartolo, Avaya  July 1, 2021

The only thing consistent about today's consumers is that they don't present a consistent face to businesses, so most companies can't rely on just a couple customer journeys to determine what consumers want and need. Progressive businesses are now deploying AI-powered customer experience platforms to enable them to manage the increasing complexity and challenges of customer interactions.


One driver of this complexity is generational differences, which businesses have had to consider for many decades. The rapid pace of change, however, has further increased the technology gap between generations. Many boomers grew up in a household with no television or one black-and-white television with just a handful of channels, and businesses communicated with customers via mail and telephone. But look what's happened since.

The time has come. Richard Branson is the first billionaire founder of a space company to be shipped off to suborbital space on Sunday on a ship he helped build. The trip on the VSS Unity will last around 90 minutes, and he'll be bringing three colleagues with him. Branson's main duty on the trip: to figure out how to make the trip even more fun for the people who go after him.

And people will, indeed, go after him. Virgin Galactic has already sold around 600 tickets for similar flights, and plans to send at least 400 people per year to space starting in 2022.

The new wave of global trade: How Alipay connects US businesses with Chinese consumers
Kate Silver  July 10, 2021
Douglas Feagin, SVP, Global Strategic Partnerships & Investments, Ant Group
 

On a recent visit to a CVS near his home in Vero Beach, Florida, Douglas Feagin realized he forgot his wallet. It was an old habit, really. Feagin, who is a senior vice president of the China-based fintech company Ant Group, usually spends a great deal of time in Asia, where his phone doubles as his wallet. "I don't ever use my wallet in China. The phone is your payment mechanism," he said. But here, in the United States, he promptly returned home to get his wallet (only Chinese citizens can use the Alipay app to make payments outside of China).

In fact, China leads most markets in its adoption of mobile payments, and Ant Group owns and operates one of the country's largest e-wallets, Alipay, which has more than 1 billion users. Alipay facilitates transactions both online and in physical retail stores. In 2020, U.S. brands sold $54 billion worth of products to Chinese consumers online through Alibaba's ecommerce platforms – sales that were facilitated by Alipay.

U.S. retailers accepting Alipay can also reach the Chinese customer at their stores in China as well as their stores here in the United States. Indeed, prior to COVID-19 travel restrictions, between April 2019 and March 2020 the Alipay app facilitated $232 million in transactions made in person by Chinese travelers at U.S. businesses.

Dallas County reaches herd immunity even as new COVID cases continue to hold steady, experts say
The Parkland Center for Clinical Innovation, which has tracked COVID-19 data for the county, said herd immunity was reached with nearly half the population having contracted the coronavirus.

Updated at 6 p.m., July 8: This story has been updated throughout.

Dallas County crossed a major threshold in its fight to curb the coronavirus pandemic this week, reaching herd immunity on July 4, according to a nonprofit that tracks health data for the county.

At least 80% of the county’s residents have either natural immunity from previously contracting COVID-19 or are vaccinated, officials at the Parkland Center for Clinical Innovation said in a statement Wednesday.

While celebrating the public health goal, officials at the center and elsewhere stressed continued caution as new strains of the virus — especially the delta variant — continue to take hold here and vaccination rates remain stagnant.

“Reaching the 80 percent herd immunity rate is not like flipping a switch, but a continuum in our journey,” said Steve Miff, the center’s CEO. “It is an important accomplishment, which is a credit to the residents and public health leaders who have committed themselves to crush COVID.”

Herd immunity occurs when more than 70% of a population has protection either from vaccinations or past infection, according to public health experts. Herd immunity does not mean the coronavirus is eliminated or that infection stops. However, such a milestone should lead to a dramatic end to an infectious disease. But public health experts have also stressed that herd immunity is “fluid” because viruses can mutate and become resistant to existent vaccines.

COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Texas due to concerns about side effects, DMN/UT-Tyler poll shows
BY ALLIE MORRIS

The center estimates that nearly 49% of the county’s population of 2.6 million residents has natural immunity after recovering from COVID-19. The calculation is based on COVID-19 test results since the beginning of the pandemic. The center assumes that for every positive test recorded in Dallas County, four other adults or five other children also had the virus.

Dallas County has seen a dramatic decrease in new cases and hospitalizations since its peak earlier this year after the winter holidays. But cases and hospitalizations have ticked up and are holding steady, Dr. Philip Huang, the county’s health director, said earlier this week. On Wednesday, the North Texas hospital region had the highest number of COVID-19 patients in beds since the spring.

“The numbers are still relatively low, but it is concerning,” Huang told county commissioners at a meeting on Tuesday.

The delta variant is predicted to make up about a quarter of all new COVID-19 cases locally, doubling about every two weeks, the center said. And given its more infectious nature, the variant could jeopardize the county’s herd immunity status. Nearly 90% of the county may need immunity to suppress a spike in the delta variant.

Herd immunity is also not uniform across Dallas County: 49 ZIP codes are above the 80% percent threshold but 45 ZIP codes are still below that mark, according to PCCI.

Among the ZIP codes with at least 80% immunity, nine have 100% protection. Those ZIP codes include most of central Dallas, including 75201, 75202, and 75207. Other ZIP codes include North Dallas’ 75251 and southern suburbs of Seagoville’s 75159 and Sunnyvale’s 75182.

The ZIP codes with the least amount of protection, PCCI said, include: North Lake Highland’s 75243 and Red Bird’s 75237.

Dr. Jamboor Vishwanatha, director for the HSC Texas Center for Health Disparities in Fort Worth, said wide gaps among ZIP codes continue to leave Dallas County vulnerable.

“Herd immunity is not a uniform distribution,” said Vishwanatha, who had not reviewed PCCI’s data. “While we can take an average for an entire county or city, there is still a lot of work to be done either because of access or hesitancy. We should not go based on an average number. If there are ZIP codes that have not reached 50 percent, we’re all still at risk.”

Only eight Dallas County ZIP codes have less than 50% protection, according to PCCI. And several of the ZIP codes are split with other counties.

Vishwanatha was not surprised that protection lags in some of Dallas County’s more white and affluent neighborhoods.

While a dearth of access and community outreach has made it challenging to inoculate Black and Latino communities, the vaccine has become a political wedge issue. And new national research suggests young adults are also a key demographic that is not seeking out the vaccine.

“It may not fall exactly on the socioeconomic line, but it’s still playing a role,” Vishwanatha said.

Dallas County’s inoculation rate continues to remain flat, the center’s data show. Less than 40% of the total population is fully vaccinated and less than 50% has received one dose.

“While previous infections and partial vaccinations do provide a level of protection,” said Miff, the center’s CEO, “all evidence suggests that full vaccinations are the most effective way to stay safe against the delta variant.”

Locally, less than 1% of those vaccinated have tested positive for COVID-19.

Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said Wednesday that the county’s job of vaccinating the public is not over, even as the county health department is expected to shutter its Fair Park mega-vaccine site on July 17.

“We’re going to be working door-to-door, incentives and pop-up clinics — every day, today, tomorrow and every other day,” Jenkins said.

How many people need to be vaccinated against COVID-19 for Dallas County to reach herd immunity?
BY CATHERINE MARFIN

CLARIFICATION 6 p.m. July 8, 2021: An earlier version included ZIP codes with low vaccination rates of cities that spanned more than one county, including Dallas County. The story has been updated to reflect only the ZIP codes within Dallas County that have the lowest vaccination rates.

2. A browser window appears with a reminder at the bottom

3. One task, one browser. Tabs can be resumed later.

What I like is that I have a screen that has everything. I have my Jira Ticket, slack message, documentation. It’s all just there, and I can close it.

Ryan Kelley

I have a high degree of distractability. That’s what really drew me in. Like the moments I am doing something, and have to drop it for something else.

🙏🏻 Namaste. I’m Ravi. Amna Guru

Let me preface by saying, that I'm not a productivity master. I'm just good with computers 🙃.

Like most millenials, I value convenience and saving time. Why learn to drive when I can just uber? Something like that.

Well the one place that isn't convenient to work is on a computer. It's like these things were designed 30 years ago with zero-insight into how people work today.

Distractions. Emails. Flashing icons. It's like a flea market.

So what comes next?

📦 Releases | 📔 Examples | ⚙️ Configuration | 🌎 Contributing

🚀 rocket-booster is a serverless reverse proxy and load balancing library built for Cloudflare Workers. It sits in front of web servers (e.g. web application, storage platform, or RESTful API), forwards HTTP requests or WebSocket traffics from clients to upstream servers and transforms responses with several optimizations to improve page loading time.

⚡ Serverless: Deploy instantly to the auto-scaling serverless platform built by Cloudflare. No virtual machines, servers, or containers to manage.
✈️ Load Balancing: Distribute incoming traffics evenly among different upstream servers.
⚙️ Hackable: Deliver unique content based on visitor attributes, conduct A/B testing, or build custom middleware to hook into the lifecycle. (Experimental)
📄 TypeScript: Extensive type declaration with TSDoc.
📦 Build and Deploy
Start with templates
Install Wrangler CLI and generate a project from the rocket-booster-template
npm install -g @cloudflare/wrangler

# JavaScript Template
wrangler generate booster-app https://github.com/booster-labs/rocket-booster-template
Install dependencies and edit the configuration in src/index.js
cd booster-app

npm install
Login and publish to Cloudflare Workers
wrangler login

wrangler publish
Integrate with existing project
Install the rocket-booster package
npm install --save rocket-booster
Import the useProxy function from rocket-booster and invoke it with a configuration object. The function returns an object with an apply() method, which takes the inbound Request to the Worker, and returns the Response fetched from the upstream server.
import useProxy from 'rocket-booster';

const config = {
  upstream: {
    domain:  'example.com',
    protocol: 'https',
  },
};

addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  const proxy = useProxy(config);
  const response = proxy.apply(event.request);
  event.respondWith(response);
});
Edit the configuration object to change the request and response. For example, the configuration below will add the header Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * to each response from the upstream server, which allows any origin to access the server.
const config = {
  upstream: {
    domain:  'example.com',
    protocol: 'https',
  },
  cors: {
    origin: '*',
  },
};
Build and publish to Cloudflare Workers
wrangler build
wrangler publish
📔 Examples
MDN Web Docs Mirror

Set up a reverse proxy for https://developer.mozilla.org:

const config = {
  upstream: {
    domain: 'developer.mozilla.org',
    protocol: 'https',
  },
};

Live Demo

WebSocket Proxy

rocket-booster could proxy WebSocket traffic to upstream servers. No additional configuration is required. Set up a reverse proxy for wss://echo.websocket.org:

const config = {
  upstream: {
    domain: 'echo.websocket.org',
    protocol: 'https',
  },
};
S3 Bucket with custom response behavior

rocket-booster could set custom headers to request and response, add CORS header, or deliver custom error responses. Set up a reverse proxy for https://example.s3.amazonaws.com:

const config = {
  upstream: {
    domain: 'example.s3.amazonaws.com',
    protocol: 'https',
  },

  header: {
    response: {
      'x-response-header': 'Hello from rocket-booster',
    },
  },

  cors: {
    origin: ['https://www.example.com'],
    methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
    credentials: true,
  },

  error: [{
    errorCode: 404,
    responsePath: '/404.html',
  }],
};
⚙️ Configuration
Upstream
domain: The domain name of the upstream server.
protocol: The protocol scheme of the upstream server. (optional, defaults to 'https')
port: The port of the upstream server. (optional, defaults to 80 or 443 based on protocol)
path: The path of the upstream server. (optional, defaults to '\')
timeout: The maximum wait time on a request to the upstream server. (optional, defaults to 10000)
const config = {
  upstream: {
    domain: 'httpbin.org',
    protocol: 'https',
    port: 443,
    path: '/',
    timeout: 10000,
  },
  /* ... */
};

To load balance HTTP traffic to a group of servers, pass an array of server configurations to upstream. Each request will be forwarded to a randomly selected server. Other load balancing algorithms will be implemented in the future.

const config = {
  upstream: [
    {
      domain: 's1.example.com',
      protocol: 'https',
    },
    {
      domain: 's2.example.com',
      protocol: 'https',
    },
    {
      domain: 's3.example.com',
      protocol: 'https',
    },
  ],
  /* ... */
};
Custom Headers
request: Sets request header going upstream to the backend. Accepts an object. (optional, defaults to {})
response: Sets response header coming downstream to the client. Accepts an object. (optional, defaults to {})
const config = {
  /* ... */
  header: {
    request: {
      'x-example-header': 'hello server',
    },
    response: {
      'x-example-header': 'hello client',
    },
  },
};
Optimization
minify: Remove unnecessary characters (like whitespace, comments, etc.) from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. (optional, defaults to false)
mirage: Detect screen size and connection speed to optimally deliver images for the current browser window. (optional, defaults to false)
const config = {
  /* ... */
  optimization: {
    mirage: true,
    minify: {
      javascript: true,
      css: true,
      html: true,
    },
  },
};

Several optimizations are enabled by default.

Brotli: Speed up page load times for visitor’s HTTPS traffic by applying Brotli compression.
HTTP/2: Improve page load time by connection multiplexing, header compression, and server push.
HTTP/3 with QUIC: Accelerate HTTP requests by using QUIC, which provides encryption and performance improvements compared to TCP and TLS.
0-RTT Connection Resumption: Improve performance for clients who have previously connected to the website.
Security
forwarded: Sets the X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Host, and X-Forwarded-Proto headers. (optional, defaults to false)
hidePoweredBy: Removes the X-Powered-By header, which is set by default in some frameworks such as Express. (optional, defaults to false)
ieNoOpen: Sets the X-Download-Options header, which is specific to Internet Explorer 8. It forces potentially-unsafe downloads to be saved, mitigating execution of HTML in the website's context. (optional, defaults to false)
xssFilter: Sets the X-XSS-Protection header to 0 to disable browsers' buggy cross-site scripting filter. (optional, defaults to false)
noSniff: Sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to nosniff. This mitigates MIME type sniffing which can cause security vulnerabilities. (optional, defaults to false)
setCookie: Sets the Domain attribute of the Set-Cookie header to the domain of the worker.
const config = {
  /* ... */
  security: {
    fowarded: true,
    hidePoweredBy: true,
    ieNoOpen: true,
    xssFilter: true,
    noSniff: true,
    setCookie: true,
  },
};
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

origin: Configures the Access-Control-Allow-Origin CORS header. (optional, defaults to false)

boolean: set to true to reflect the request origin, or set to false to disable CORS.
string[]: an array of acceptable origins.
*: allow any origin to access the resource.

methods: Configures the Access-Control-Allow-Methods CORS header. Expects an array of valid HTTP methods or *. (optional, defaults to reflecting the method specified in the request’s Access-Control-Request-Method header)

allowedHeaders: Configures the Access-Control-Allow-Headers CORS header. Expects an array of HTTP headers or *. (optional, defaults to reflecting the headers specified in the request’s Access-Control-Request-Headers header.)

exposedHeaders: Configures the Access-Control-Expose-Headers CORS header. Expects an array of HTTP headers or *. (optional, defaults to [])

credentials: Configures the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials CORS header. Set to true to pass the header, otherwise it is omitted. (optional, defaults to false)

maxAge: Configures the Access-Control-Max-Age CORS header. Set to an integer to pass the header, otherwise it is omitted. (optional)

const config = {
  /* ... */
  cors: {
    origin: true,
    methods: [
      'GET',
      'POST',
    ],
    allowHeaders: [
      'Example-Header',
    ],
    exposeHeaders: [
      'Example-Header',
    ],
    credentials: true,
    maxAge: 86400,
  },
};
Custom Error Response

errorCode: The HTTP status code to return a custom error response to the client. Excepts a valid HTTP status code or an array of valid status code.

responsePath: The path and file name of the custom error page for this HTTP status code. For example: /error-pages/403-forbidden.html

responseCode: The HTTP status code to return to the client along with the custom error page. (optional, defaults to the original error code)

const config = {
  /* ... */
  error: {
    errorCode: 404,
    responsePath: '/404.html',
  },
};

To customize the response of multiple error codes, pass an array of error response objects to error.

const config = {
  /* ... */
  error: [
    {
      errorCode: 404,
      responsePath: '/404.html',
    },
    {
      errorCode: [500, 501, 502, 503],
      responsePath: '/500.html',
      responseCode: 500,
    },
  ],
};

Package Managers and Developer Productivity
July 12, 2021

Tools like GitHub Copilot help developers write code faster, but what is faster than using code someone else has already written? Package managers are the way that software developers share and use others' code. But ask any developer; package managers are universally hated. Package managers seem like they are the source of new bugs and frustrations, and usually, they are. But the benefit of sharing code is so great. It outweighs nearly any cost. Every developer relies on someone else's code.

What is a Package?

There are two types of package managers I'm talking about - one at the operating system level that distributes binaries (usually thought of as "apps"), and one at the programming language level that distributes source code.  

I loosely define a package as an archive and its metadata. The archive can be a compiled executable or simply just code. The metadata includes the version, the application's dependencies needed to run, documentation, and a checksum - verification that the contents of what was downloaded precisely match the intended contents.

A package manager has a few primary responsibilities: (1) Installing, maintaining, and removing packages. (2) Dependency resolution. The second deserves a blog post, but dependency resolution is sorting out what other packages the package depends on. You can run into circular dependencies, long chains, conflict, and more. It is a complex problem. It's proven to be a complicated problem mathematically - it is in a set of problems known as NP-complete, which means non-deterministic polynomial-time; it's going to take a long time.

How is code shared?

Code is usually statically or dynamically linked. Statically linked means that an application is shipped with all of its dependencies. Dynamically linked implies that it may share a common package or library with another package. Dynamic linking is usually more space-efficient but opens up more issues, such as what happens when two packages require two different versions of a common dependency?

Three trends driving Package Management

More code, more reuse. Back in the day, developers would commonly "roll their own," which meant writing their own implementation of a particular algorithm or function. Now, so much code is out there and discoverable (through GitHub) that we can find code that serves our purpose without having to write it ourselves
Containers. You can think of containers as a high-level package. Containers are a reasonably new abstraction - made popular in the last few years (I worked on containers at Google). Inevitability, packages have dependencies both at the code level and the operating system level. Containers allow developers to specify both in a package.
More reuse, larger dependency graphs. The dependencies between software are getting so complex that it's difficult to reason out what depends on what. For example, in Google's large codebase, there were commonly very confusing circular dependencies.

Open problems

Different programming languages have different package managers. Can we take common problems and generically solve them?
There is no container package manager. Therefore, we need a package manager for the meta-package manager.
Operating system package managers are antiquated and not fit for the future. They were developed for consumers use but aren't suitable for large-scale cloud deployments.
No discovery tools for packages besides GitHub. How do developers find out what packages can satisfy their requirements? There are few ways for package authors to reach potential users directly. AdWords for developers? Better distribution?

Hello, Content Creators. Silicon Valley’s Investors Want to Meet You.

The online influencer culture is starting to draw serious interest from big venture capital firms. But the real money could be in digital tools, not the personalities.

By Taylor Lorenz and Erin Woo

July 12, 2021, 5:00 a.m. ET

Last summer, Tucker Schreiber, a 28-year-old co-founder of a start-up called Combo that was building a video editing platform, noticed a lot more emails in his inbox. Though his company had no employees and no products, and hadn’t even said it was looking for money, investors were sending him a stream of messages.

“I started getting five to 10 inbound emails daily for a couple weeks straight from investors,” he said.

Mr. Schreiber’s start-up was riding a boom in investors targeting the so-called creator or influencer economy. The boom in the creator economy itself has renewed interest in social media among venture capitalists, who for years thought there was little point to looking for social upstarts with the likes of Facebook and Snap (which owns Snapchat) sucking all the air out of the market.

Creators are people who build audiences online and find a way to make money from those audiences. They are usually young, digital natives who are trying to make a living from their social media work. And big Silicon Valley investors increasingly see them as the next financial vein to be tapped on the internet.

The creator economy, which provides digital tools to influencers and helps them run their businesses, is a huge, largely unexplored market. The venture capital firm SignalFire estimates that 50 million people around the world consider themselves content creators, while the technology news site The Information estimates that venture capital firms have invested $2 billion into 50 creator-focused start-ups so far this year.

The heightened interest from traditional venture capitalists could offer legitimacy to what some may still think is a fringe business. It could also add to the notion that this growing world of dance, chat and comedy is more than ephemeral youth culture.

But as the saying goes, don’t invest in the gold miners — sell them their tools. Silicon Valley appears far more interested in the digital tools and platforms used by the content creators than investing directly in the creators themselves.

Last month, for example, the venture firm Founders Fund took the lead in a $15 million investment round for Pietra, a start-up aimed at helping influencers launch product lines. In April, Seven Seven Six, a venture firm run by Alexis Ohanian, a Reddit co-founder, and Bessemer Venture Partners announced a $16 million investment in PearPop, a platform that helps creators monetize their collaborations and social media interactions.

The list goes on. In February, the high-profile venture firm Andreessen Horowitz led an investment in Stir, a platform that helps creators manage how they make money, valuing the company at $100 million.

Dispo, a photo sharing app that mimics the experience of digital cameras, received $4 million in a funding round led by Seven Seven Six and an additional $20 million investment round led by Spark Capital. The venture stalwart Benchmark led an investment round reportedly worth up $20 million in Poparazzi, an app that allows users’ friends to post photos to their profiles, effectively turning their cohorts into their “paparazzi.”

And then there is Clubhouse, the heavyweight of this young market, generating plenty of buzz from Silicon Valley and the media and entertainment world. Clubhouse, which requires an invitation to join, is a social network built around audio-only chat rooms. In April, it raised $200 million in a funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz, putting its valuation at roughly $4 billion.

“When I first started in venture capital in 2016, there was this pervasive belief that” it would be really difficult for another major social network to come along, said Li Jin, founder of Atelier, a venture firm focused on the online creator world.

TikTok upended all of that. By focusing on influencers, the app forced changes from traditional social networks like Instagram and Twitter that had shied away from catering to the people who were creating the popular content on their platforms.

TikTok allowed up-and-coming social media personalities to be discovered more easily, and gave them a clearer direct path to making money through the company’s Creator Fund, which pays creators a certain amount based on views.

“Older social platforms, those were all about interacting with your friends online,” said Linus Walton, vice president at the Chernin Group, an investment firm. Now “it’s all about becoming that influencer, or becoming that new TikTok star that all your friends are watching.”

Subscription services like OnlyFans and Patreon, where fans pay creators for access to premium content, also helped investors realize there was a strong business case for building tools for creators. Now the word “creator” has become a buzzword, appended to all types of businesses to attract investors. So much so that Alexander Finden, a tech entrepreneur, coined the term “creator washing.”

“There are more creator economy start-ups than creators,” Turner Novak, founder of Banana Capital, which invests in early-stage tech start-ups, joked on Twitter in April.

Rex Woodbury, a 27-year-old principal at the San Francisco investment firm Index Ventures, represents a bit of both worlds. He started out as an influencer, building an audience of more than 237,000 followers on Instagram by posting lifestyle content. After he graduated from college, he went full time into investment, where he has carved a niche as an authority in the creator economy.

“I’ve seen a few posts from V.C.s saying, ‘Eight of the 10 companies I met with today are creator companies,’” Mr. Woodbury said. “It really is en vogue now.”

He joined Index Ventures in December, just as venture capitalists were starting to get interested in creators and were looking for help from people who understood the landscape.

“A lot of young investors feel credible in this because we are digital natives,” Mr. Woodbury said. “This is the world we grew up in.”

Now, major platforms like Spotify, Twitter and Facebook are rushing to catch up to start-ups, particularly Clubhouse. Spotify recently announced its new live audio app, Greenroom, a Clubhouse competitor that Spotify built after acquiring the live audio start-up Locker Room. Twitter has already added its own Clubhouse rival, Twitter Spaces, and both Twitter and Facebook are starting newsletter services to compete with the success of Substack, which allows users to easily set up subscriptions for their writing.

With the lines between venture capital and the creator world blurring, many traditional venture capitalists are also seeking to become creators themselves. Firms like Andreessen Horowitz have leveraged their investment in Clubhouse to promote their staff through the app’s suggested user list. Nait Jones, a partner with Andreessen Horowitz, has amassed over four million followers on Clubhouse and recently signed with the talent agency WME.

Still, while investors are racing to put their money in social media start-ups, it’s less clear whether some of the apps on the market will last. Dispo, February’s buzziest social media start-up, faced backlash a month later after one of its co-founders, the YouTube star David Dobrik, was ensnared in controversy over sexual assault claims against a member of his “Vlog Squad.” Soon after, Spark Capital said it had severed all ties with the company. Seven Seven Six did not sever ties but said it would donate profits to an organization working with assault survivors.

Poparazzi, which captured the top spot among free iPhone apps in the last week of May, had dropped to No. 156 by mid-June, according to the app research firm Sensor Tower. And while Sensor Tower data reports that Clubhouse had 5.3 million downloads in the first two weeks of June, 4.8 million were of its Android app, which was introduced in late May.

“For years, no one cared or recognized this space as a space with real money,” said Bobby Thakkar, 21, co-founder of Ampersand, a product studio that builds tools for creators. “Now, with money pouring into the industry, we’re only going to see more companies, more competition and more start-ups involving creators as a part of their businesses.”

If slow evolution–the accumulation of tiny changes over geologic time–is insufficient to account for all evolutionary leaps, so the theory goes, then perhaps there exist macroevolutionary jumps due to large mutations that create organisms with significant advantages over their erstwhile species. These macro-mutant organisms are dubbed Hopeful Monsters, born without kin or kind, seeking that slimmest improbable chance to thrive.

This is by no means widely accepted–common criticisms point rightly to the fact that macroevolutionary mutations are almost invariably lethal, or render the mutant sterile, unable to propagate their mutation forward.

This all, looking at the history of fledgling startups born from the roiling primordial soup of our VC bubble, sounds about right. Fuck Social Darwinism, but how about Corporate Goldschmidtism?

A lineup of Dead Startup Toys on a shelf is the equivalent of a line of heads on stakes, or the macabre pyramids of Kublai Khan. Not exactly triumphant, given that companies fail through no real fault of our own, as consumers, but schadenfreude is a small sadism, after all.

This is not a memorialization. Let Theranos burn and never taste the light of heaven. Still we are perhaps honor-bound to acknowledge the mutants, for they accomplish a certain weirding of the world that we aspire to. Dead Startup Toys are not a resurrection, to be sure, but perhaps they are a form of necromancy: we celebrate their pale shadows, deprived of their original context.

Behold these beautiful mutants, hoisted on petards of their own solid-aluminum-unibody construction. We salute these voyagers, flown too close to the blood-red suns of their own fever dreams, on wings made of oh-so-flammable dollar bills, whose inexplicably sincere hopes became our most surreal entertainment...

How to really learn Go
A student’s handbook

I teach Go for a living at my software engineering school, the Bitfield Institute of Technology, and I'm writing this post partly as advice for my students, but I think much of it applies to anyone who's trying to learn Go, or indeed anything at all. Consider this your Student's Handbook for Go University.

What follows are a few tips which I've found useful myself, and which I give to everybody who studies with me; if you read them, think about them, and (don't forget this step) apply them, you'll find they will not only speed up your progress dramatically, but they'll make a real difference to your ability to learn and master Go.

1. Practice every day

For 37 years I’ve practiced 14 hours a day, and now they call me a genius.
—Pablo de Sarasate

Every musician or martial artist knows this, and so does anyone who's successfully learned some difficult craft or skill. You need to practice every day. If you do, you'll make far more rapid progress, and probably get much further, than someone who just puts in two or three sessions a week.

(You can still make some progress studying once a week, but it will be terribly slow, and you'll spend most of your time just making up the ground you've lost in between sessions. If you're studying less than once a week, forget it: just watch TV instead. If you're going to achieve nothing, you may as well do so with less effort.)

"Practice every day": easy to say, of course, but difficult to achieve in reality, at least for those of us with busy lives (which is all of us). The Tiny Habits book advises us to "take baby steps" when trying to establish a new habit. This is a great idea.

Don't start out trying to do an hour a day, for example; this just isn't sustainable. None of us have a spare hour in our day, just waiting for some activity like Go learning to fill it. Instead, start with 15 minutes a day. That may not sound like enough time to learn anything useful, but that's not the point. The point is to establish the habit of daily practice.

Pick a time of day when you tend to have the most mental energy and focus (usually earlier in the day, rather than later). Set yourself a repeating appointment in your calendar for a 15-minute Go session; if possible, at the same time every day. That makes the habit easier to establish.

When the appointed time comes, put yourself into "Go mode": sit down at your computer, open your code editor, and load your current project. You may not feel like doing anything at all. That's normal. Your goal is simply to spend the 15 minutes in a situation where you can study or practice Go.

If all you do is stare at your program for 15 minutes and then turn the computer off, that's okay. You've done it. You've won. Just keep doing this every day. Your sole purpose is to convince your brain that these regular sessions are important, and something it needs to do.

If you can keep up the daily sessions for two weeks, you'll almost certainly find that it becomes much less effort, and requires less willpower, to start each session. Eventually, it will become normal and natural, and not something you need to effort yourself into, and you'll find you don't really want to stop after the prescribed 15 minutes (that's okay. You don't have to!)

2: Write code

Remove wrapper, open mouth, insert muffin, eat.
—7-11 muffin instructions

There are lots of ways to study a programming language like Go: you can read books, watch videos, read tutorials and blog posts; all of these are valuable. But by far the most effective way to learn to write Go is to write Go. Don't do quizzes or timed interview challenges, don't answer multiple-choice questions, instead write a program.

It literally doesn't matter what the program is about. In fact, you shouldn't even worry about trying to pick useful projects; just write some Go that does anything. The point is to exercise your Go muscles. You should still do this even if you write Go every day at work; you need to have a project with no stakes, no expectations, no deadline, and where you can do whatever you want, which doesn't tend to be true of work projects.

Here are some ideas:

A simple calculator
A little bookstore
A CPU emulator
An adventure game
A website link checker

Your project doesn't need to be unique, innovative, challenging, useful, or even interesting (okay, it helps if it's interesting). Just do something. Print out the prime numbers, or count the number of files in a directory, or play tic-tac-toe, or Conway's Game of Life, or draw the Mandelbrot set. You get the idea. Pick a project, and start.

3: Read code

The effective programmer is keenly aware of the limited size of his own head.
—Edsger Dijkstra

There are very few successful writers who've written more books than they've read. The same applies to programmers. Writing good code is largely a matter of having good taste, and the way to develop good taste is to read other people's programs, both good and bad.

Explore GitHub for Go projects; pick things at random that look interesting, and start reading. Read the documentation, read the code. Ideally, clone the repository and browse it using your own editor, with its Go-specific facilities for navigating and annotating code.

Read big programs, like Kubernetes, or Terraform, or Go itself. Read little programs by beginners. Read the code in the standard library. Read solutions to programming challenges. Read the source for command-line tools, or web browsers, or operating systems. Learn how projects are put together, how code is organised, and how functions and types are named and grouped together.

Start a Code Club with friends or colleagues where you each read a piece of Go code, and discuss it. What was interesting about it? What was new to you? What didn't you understand? What did you think might be wrong, or could be improved? What ideas could you borrow for your own programs? What introduced you to a whole new topic you'd never heard of before?

Students sometimes ask "But how do I read code? Do I start at the first line of the first file and work through in sequence? Do I skim-read or go line by line? Do I follow every function call, or understand the high-level stuff first, then go deeper?"

Basically, do whatever works for you, but a good starting point is to find the main function, if there is one, or the entry point of the library, and proceed from there following the normal execution of the program.

Read each line of code carefully. If you understand that line completely, go on to the next. If you don't, look again and think about it. Check the documentation or the language spec if you can't understand what's happening. If you get completely stuck, make a note of the problematic function or line, and move on. Follow up on your notes later by asking a colleague or mentor if they can understand the tricky bit and explain it to you.

The more code you read, the more you'll be able to write. No idea is new or original; everything is borrowed from somewhere else. You are building up a store of concepts, techniques, and tricks that you can draw on when it comes to your own programs. Don't read books, read code. (Well, do read books, of course, but don't fool yourself that it's a substitute for careful, thoughtful, code reading).

4: Manage your time

In truth, people can generally make time for what they choose to do; it is not really the time but the will that is lacking.
—John Lubbock

This might seem an odd one; what's time management got to do with Go? The answer is, a lot. Time management is, succinctly, learning how to spend your time on stuff you want to do, and not on stuff you don't.

Ever said to someone, "I really want to learn Go, but I just don't have the time"? Here's a question: how many hours of TV do you watch in a week? (Yes, Netflix and YouTube count as TV.) Now, I'm not putting down TV (or podcasts, or movies, or audiobooks, or Facebook, or Hacker News, or any other form of on-demand entertainment); it's great. Sometimes you just need to unwind. But for how long?

Try this experiment for one week: make a note of every hour you spend watching TV, scrolling through social media or news sites, or otherwise passively consuming entertainment, and review it at the end of the week. What does it add up to? Fifteen, twenty hours? More? Did you really intend to spend all that time on entertainment, or did it just sort of happen by accident?

Could you take, say, just two of those hours a week, and spend them on 15-minute daily study sessions instead? How much more rewarding would it be to look back on a week's learning than a week's binge-watching?

There are 168 hours in a week (fun fact). How you spend them is at least partly up to you. Sure, you're busy; everybody's busy. As Thoreau said, the ants are busy too. The question is, what are we busy about?

Be punctual, not just for your study sessions, but for everything. If you're five minutes late here, ten minutes late there, it all adds up. Sooner or later you're hours behind where you meant to be, and you can't afford to lose that time. And being late for things is a classic tell: it means you're not managing your time properly.

5: Pick a direction

Steering is more important than speed, in driving and in software development.
—Ron Jeffries

Why do you want to learn Go? Do you want to land a job as a developer or infrastructure engineer? Do you want to move to a more interesting role within your current company? Do you want to feel more confident and productive in the job you have? Do you want to contribute to open source projects? Or do you simply enjoy the mental challenge and fun of programming as a hobby?

These are all the right answer; the point is to ask the question. Once you know why you're learning Go, you can figure out which direction to take. You'll never learn Go completely, in the sense of mastering the discipline to the point where there's nothing you don't know. Instead, we're all on a learning journey that will last a lifetime. The question you need to answer now is where are you heading?

If you're applying, or preparing to apply, for Go dev jobs, find five or ten vacancies which you can realistically see yourself interviewing for. What specific skills or knowledge do they need? Do you have it? What experience is necessary? Do you have that experience? If not, how could you get it? If they ask for related skills such as networking, databases, or cloud, do you feel you've got that stuff covered? What could you do to boost your knowledge in these areas?

If you want to write programs for fun, what kind of programs? Where do you feel unconfident or lacking in knowledge and experience? What sort of projects would help you gain it? Are there existing projects you could contribute to?

None of us have as much time or energy as we'd like to; the key is knowing how to prioritise what we have. In your 15 minutes today, what are you going to study? Have a list of topics, tasks, and projects prepared, so you can just dive straight in and get to work. Check things off as you cover them; each checkmark takes you one step closer to where you want to go.

6: Make a plan

I try to take one day at a time, but sometimes several days attack at once.
—Ashleigh Brilliant

When you've worked out the big things you want to learn, or the competencies you want to attain, break them down into smaller steps. For example, you might say "By the end of January, I want to feel really confident I understand concurrency in Go." Make a plan for how to achieve this: week by week, day by day. Assume things won't go to plan. That's normal. You'll need to constantly re-evaluate, adjust, and update the plan as you go; what matters is to have the plan.

Plan each day. This really helps. Okay, certain things are already blocked out: work, meetings, taking the kids to school. But you still have some open spaces in your schedule; if you don't fill them, someone else will. Make a rough plan at the start of each day, first thing, before the day can attack you. "Before work I'll be studying Go, after lunch I'll be doing this work project, from 2 to 2.30 I'll be catching up on emails", and so on. Planning what you'll be doing literally every hour of the day sounds borderline obsessive-compulsive, but trust me. It works.

Check the plan throughout the day to remind yourself what you intended to do at this time. You won't be able to do all of it. Stuff comes up; that's just a given. But if you can push back on it to the extent of carving out an extra half an hour or an hour of intentional work or study, you've won. Do the same again tomorrow.

Review your plans at the end of the week. How did you do? What went right? What knocked you off course? What will you do better next week?

Every month, review what you intended to achieve. Did you achieve it? (Probably not entirely, but don't sweat it; you'll have done a thousand percent more than if you hadn't made a plan.)

7: Learn things

Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible.
—Richard Feynman

A common question among Go students is "what should I study?" Yes, Go, but what specifically? You can't learn everything, so where should you start?

If you're a beginner, focus first on getting as much practice as you can simply writing Go code. Once you feel reasonably confident and fluent with Go, start filling in the knowledge gaps. Read the Go spec and look for things you didn't know, or don't feel confident you could explain to someone else. Study and practice those things.

Look at Go's standard library. Are you familiar with all of it? If not, look deeper. Read the docs. Think you know the fmt library? Keep reading until you've found at least one thing you didn't know about. Use it in a program.

Get practice building bigger projects, designing package APIs, and writing libraries. Figure out what makes a program readable, flexible, extensible, maintainable, scalable. Study other people's projects. How do they work? What lessons could you apply to your own code?

Read around the subject. Build your general tech knowledge. Find out how compilers work, what's inside a CPU, where TCP/IP comes from, what the HTTP protocol says. Learn about HTML, JSON, the Unix shell, computer graphics, disks, databases. Study algorithms, data structures, math, programming language design, debuggers, SQL, operating systems, distributed systems, infrastructure.

It literally isn't possible to know too much about software engineering. It's easy to be put off by people who write knowledgeable-sounding books or blog posts, but don't be. They started out in the exact same place as you, and they just sat down and learned stuff. You can too.

8: Exercise

One day’s exposure to mountains is better than a cartload of books.
—John Muir

Wait, what? How is exercise going to help you learn anything? If you're already short on time, shouldn't you spend every available minute coding or reading, instead of flinging kettlebells around?

No. That leads to burnout. Richard Steele wrote that "reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body", and those two things go together. If you neglect the body, the mind will suffer, and vice versa.

Physical exercise has a powerful effect on your mood, energy, motivation, quality of sleep, focus, and mental sharpness. As a student, you need to make a special effort to get regular exercise; it's a force multiplier for your study sessions.

Do something strenuous every day, whether it's walking, climbing stairs, lifting weights, jogging, cycling, yoga, martial arts, sport, or... well, use your imagination. Anything that gets your heart pumping and breaks a sweat is good. You don't need much. Half an hour a day is fine, and it's half an hour more exercise than the vast majority of people get.

Don't bother joining a gym; you won't go. Instead, make the world your gym. Walk to work or the shops instead of driving. Take the stairs instead of the lift. Use a standing desk. Get some weights or resistance bands and work out with them when you're watching TV. If you see a hill, walk up it. When you're on a long Zoom meeting, do jumping jacks (put yourself on mute first).

9: Eat well

Having enough to eat: that is joy. Knowing when one is full: that is wisdom.
—Deng Ming-Dao

Eat good food, and not too much. Don't starve yourself or binge; have some balance in your diet. You don't have to live on brown rice; that's not what your body was built for. Instead, eat sensibly, in moderation, and learn how to listen to your body. It knows what it needs.

Eat when you're hungry, sleep when you're tired. Know when to push yourself, and when to rest. You don't drive your car everywhere at a hundred miles an hour until it breaks down; don't try to do the same with your body.

Cook meals instead of eating processed foods. Yes, cooking takes time, preparation, and planning (so does learning Go). But it's also fun, especially if you do it in company. When you cook, make enough for three meals. Eat one, refrigerate one, freeze one. Today you earned your dinner, but tomorrow and the day after, magic meals will just appear as if from nowhere!

10: Be still

The mind is only a vehicle. When we don’t need our legs we don’t use them. Likewise, let the mind rest when not needed.
—Jean Klein

Every minute of every day, we're assailed on all sides by noise, people, traffic, conversation, phone calls, text messages, emails, interruptions, crying babies, breaking news. This non-stop assault has a serious impact on our mental well-being, and that relates directly to our ability to think, study, and learn.

Have you ever wanted to do some study or programming, but just felt like you haven't got the energy? Your brain just doesn't want to co-operate. Instead, it craves the sugary stimulation of Twitter, or texting, or TV. You and me both.

The human brain actually needs a non-zero amount of peace and silence in order to function properly. But unless you live on top of a mountain, or perhaps under the sea, genuine silence is really hard to achieve. Everybody wants a piece of your attention, and unless you push back—hard—they'll simply keep taking until there's nothing left.

The good news is that you can make space for yourself to just be. Everyone can. Call it "meditation", "quiet time", "just sitting", or whatever you want. It doesn't matter what you call it: it only matters that you take a few minutes every day just to be still and quiet.

Some people find it conducive to sit, or stand, or lie down. Some prefer to take a long walk. For some, jogging or cycling is their meditation. Your mileage may vary. The point is to give your brain a chance to slow down and cool off, without being constantly pinged and poked at.

At first you'll find it helpful to get well away from other people: shut yourself in a room (the bathroom can work, provided you don't hog it for too long). Failing that, sit in your car, or go to the park, or find a grove of trees.

Turn your phone off, or leave it behind. Most phones have a 'do not disturb' mode, where you can block all calls and messages, but still allow specific people to reach you (your partner, your kids, your transplant surgeon). Use it.

If you have a partner or a family, tell them about your need for quiet time, and get them to help you by protecting it. Maybe they'd like some quiet time too. You could try all being quiet together; that's actually kind of fun.

Here's a very important warning: the first few times you try to be quiet and still, it will be really difficult. Your brain is just not used to its own company. All kinds of crazy thoughts will keep popping into your head. You will feel bored, antsy, uncomfortable, even anxious. You will have incredibly strong urges to just quit and do something else (specifically, to check your phone). Don't feel bad. This is normal.

So again, don't try to do too much at first. Aim for fifteen minutes. Set your phone alarm or kitchen timer (ideally, not one of those really harsh and jarring ones) and sit still for the allotted time. If you genuinely can't do fifteen minutes, that's okay (most people probably can't at first). See how many minutes you can do (maybe five), and tomorrow, try to do one more, and the day after, one more than that.

Don't try to make yourself calm, or empty your mind, or breathe a certain way, or anything like that. Don't use a meditation app, or ambient music, or whale song. Just sit, and let yourself be with yourself for a while. There's really nothing to it (and that's the point). If you're efforting, you're doing it wrong. This is one thing in life you can't succeed or fail at, because you're not doing anything at all. If you're sitting, you're winning.

Thoughts will enter your mind and go round and round; the more you try to push them away, the more fuss they will make, so stop pushing and let them come. You'll find that if you don't fight them, they will just pass over you and drift away, like clouds across the sky. After a while, your brain will run out of thoughts and give up, and you'll find that you naturally become calm, without any struggle or effort. The only way to win is not to fight.

If something really important, urgent, or valuable occurs to you, don't start thinking about it, and don't try to remember it: just write it down. (Keep a notebook or a pen and paper for this purpose; don't use your phone.) Once your brain knows that the thought has been saved for later, it won't waste any further energy thinking it.

If you make the effort to carve out just a few minutes peace and quiet for yourself every day, you'll find it rapidly gets easier, and you stop getting the unmanageable desire to quit. Even though your brain is not used to the silence, that's what it wants, what it craves.

Your brain has been denied this peace and quiet for perhaps your entire life. Once it starts getting it, it's like an addiction: you'll want more, and still more. Eventually you won't need to make a special time and place for silence. You'll find life is full of opportunities for mini-meditations: when you're waiting for the lights to change, or the meeting to start, or the bus to arrive. And when you do get some time to yourself, you'll be comfortable just walking, or just sitting and being, without any kind of external stimulation or distraction, alone with yourself.

You'll find you have more mental energy, it'll be easier to motivate yourself to study, and you'll make more progress and retain more when you do. You'll sleep better, and longer. You'll be more productive when you're at work, and more relaxed when you're not. You'll want to evangelise the benefits of meditation to everyone you meet. (Don't do this, it's annoying. Instead of telling everyone about the joy of silence, just be it yourself. Sooner or later, they will get the idea, and try it themselves, or they won't. It's all good.)

Freelance React Developer Checklist
JULY 11, 2021
 BY ROBIN WIERUCH
 - EDIT THIS POST
 Follow on Facebook

As a freelance React developer, I work with a lot of clients on their React projects these days. Every time I get a request in my inbox, I usually reply with the same email template which I call the freelance checklist for React developers.

If you are going to sign up for my Newsletter, you will get two email templates -- one from the perspective of a hiring company and one from the perspective of a replying freelancer.

Essentially this checklist makes your onboarding as a React freelance developer more seaming-less when entering a new project and team, because before a company can hire you as a React freelancer, both sides need to talk through this checklist to get their requirements aligned.

Here I want to share the items of this checklist in more detail with you -- whether you are are a on-site/remote React freelancer who is looking for a job or a company who wants to hire a React freelancer.

REACT FREELANCE CHECKLIST

There are always some details which I want to know as a freelancer before working with a company such as:

What's my role in the project?
What's the deadline/milestone for the project?
What's the background of the company?

However, two of the most important questions for me and other freelancers are the following:

Is it a greenfield project? Many freelancers see this as a benefit, because they can be more creative on how to architect the project and which libraries they choose for it while avoiding legacy code in the frontend. However, it's not always the case that you are working on a greenfield project. What I have seen mostly in my career as a remote freelancer were up-and-running projects which ran into challenges and sought for help, because of either missing expertise in React or missing frontend developer power.

Who is the team? Depending on the freelancer, you may prefer to work alone or in a team. Working alone can mean two things: Working literally alone on a MVP or working alone as frontend developer but in a vertical tech stack with backend engineers, designers, etc. It can also happen that the company who wants to hire you as a freelancer onboards more than one freelancer to their project. Then it's always good to know who is in charge for the frontend, because if it's only freelancers working on it, it can lead to long discussions.

FREELANCE COMMUNICATION CHECKLIST

When I am working with a new company on their React project, I always try to establish five communication channels:

Real-Time: Tools like Slack help to discuss topics in real-time with the stakeholders of the project. It's also the water cooler chat if you like to hang out with the team in the case of a long term project. Anyway, if you want to have a discussion about a topic, this kind of channel is the best for it. However, if it's about specific tasks (and the question is not super urgent), the task manager would be the better place.

Task Manager: The communication in a task manager like Trello is more asynchronous than the real-time communication channel, however, this really helps to stay on topic for a specific task. In addition, even though the tasks are done eventually, the stakeholders of the project have always a reference to the past whether it's just linking back to it when having a discussion or looking up why certain decisions were made.

Pull Requests: Once a task is finished, PRs are used for code reviews. Even though there is not always a code review happening, the PR can be used to be linked back to the task in the task manager as reference. Vice versa, the task should be linked to the PR.

Email: Personally I try to use E-Mail conversations as little as possible and only for more important topics which need to be discussed with stakeholders higher in the command chain (e.g. CEO, PO). Most of the time these people are in the real-time communication channel though, so E-Mail is only used for the onboarding experience and invoicing.

Meetings: Yes, even though you are a freelancer, there will be meetings! Depending on how much you are doing for your client, the meetings will happen more often to discuss past or upcoming tasks. In my case, I had clients with weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly meetings. Usually as a freelancer I am not involved in the daily standup sessions though.

As a freelancer working for a company, you should be invited to all these channels at the beginning. If you are working with a larger company, you will be bombarded with invites anyway. So if you don't want to get into VPN et al., ask your client beforehand how much freelancer onboarding for their infrastructure is needed

WORKFLOW CHECKLIST AS A REACT FREELANCER

If you are entering an established team, they will already have their workflow and you have to get used to it. This ranges from kanban to scrum, from code reviews to no code reviews, from pushing on master to feature branches. However, if you can change something about it -- which was often the case for me -- or you are the first developer on the MVP, I've got a short list of workflow tips for you:

Do we do Kanban, Scrum, or Power Yoga? If I am working with a small team, I am often proposing Kanban for its lean approach. For example, Trello is an established and well-known project management tool for it. Regarding Kanban itself, stick to the official rules: number of lanes, max. number of items per developer per lane, etc.

Do we do code reviews? If not working alone, yes. If you have any power to establish proper code reviews for your team, please do it. It will help the whole team to understand each others code, to find bugs, and to discuss cause and effect when introducing something new in the code base.

Do we do feature branches? If not working alone, yes. Having everyone pushing on master/develop branches will automatically lead to conflicts. If the team does not know about feature branches, I point them to this step-by-step tutorial.

Because you are a freelance React developer, companies want to hire you most likely for their frontend application of their web application. However, this does not mean that everything you will code for this client is a 100% React.

You have to see yourself more as a T-shaped developer, because usually you are working with a team in a vertical stack which encapsulates design, frontend, backend, database, and business. While the database is most often out of your scope, you will likely interact with designers from UI/UX, backend engineers for the API requirements, and other business/tech stakeholders such as POs/PMs/CTOs/CEOs.

UI/UX CHECKLIST AS A REACT FREELANCER

One of the most popular questions: Should I make it look good or pixel perfect? Often this depends on the size of the company that's hiring you. If there is a whole UI/UX department, it will be most likely pixel perfect -- which means that you will get design mockups from the design team and you need to match them with every pixel (margins, paddings, borders, heights, widths etc.) in HTML and CSS.

In contrast, if you are working with a smaller client, it can happen that there is no person responsible for the UI and thus you are asked to make it look good. However, from pixel perfect to make it look good is a spectrum. There will be companies in between which will provide mockups but without the "pixel perfect into code translation" as a requirement.

Where do I get the mockups from? If you are asked to work with mockups as a freelance web developer, usually the design team already has their tools of choice to provide the mockups to you. These design tools range from "just getting a PDF with images" to a fully interactive mocked application (which often encapsulates the UX by having user interactions in place as well). The most common tools I had the pleasure to work with are Zeplin, Invision, or Figma.

As said, it really depends on the company hiring you as a React freelancer and their resources. Sometimes you have to create the mockups together with the CEO in a meeting, sometimes you get screenshots from their legacy application (not always the best foundation, but it can work out with guidance), and sometimes you are working with a full-fledged design team which has a solution ready for every screen and user interaction.

What color scheme, fonts, and assets should I use? If you are working with a design team, they got you covered. Usually a PDF or link with/to design guidelines points you to a color scheme and the fonts which should be used. In addition, a link to a cloud storage (e.g. Google Drive) will give you access to all the assets (e.g. logo, icons). However, if you are working without a dedicated design team or designer, these questions need to be asked when you onboard as a freelance React developer to a new project.

Are we using in-house icons? Maybe not for the first onboarding conversation, but definitely a thing you should speak through with your client. Again, when working with a design team (or using a popular UI library), usually the icons are already there.

However, if you are working with a smaller company and their requirements say that you need to use custom icons (not recommended, because of the extra work, but it can happen for highly specialized domains), someone has to create these icons. Regardless of who is creating the icons, be aware that all icons need to meet a shared set of requirements (size, color scheme, margins etc.).

Should this React project work on mobile too? Here again, if you are working with a design team and a bigger company in general, they will already know whether they want their project only on desktop, desktop-first yet also on mobile, or even mobile-first.

But if you are working with a smaller company, it's important how you communicate this topic as a freelance React developer, because if you ask the client whether the application should be responsive for mobile/tablet/desktop, they will most likely say yes without considering the immense workload (extra mockups cost, extra implementation cost, various edge cases).

API CHECKLIST AS A REACT FREELANCER

When being hired as a freelance frontend developer, the kind of backends you are dealing with ranges from "legacy backend which got a new REST API for making things web compatible" to "a newly created backend with a REST or even GraphQL API". Most likely the backend isn't a finished project though, because it often grows with the requirements of the frontend (e.g. changing APIs, introducing new APIs, splitting up APIs, performance optimizations for heavy load screens, specialized APIs for offset/cursor-based pagination etc.).

What's important for you as a freelance React developer is the API. So your first question should be: What kind of API does your backend offer? Personally, I like to work with GraphQL APIs, but since these are not the status quo (yet), the likelihood of working with a REST API is pretty high -- which is okay by me!

Anyway, no REST API is true REST like it was proposed by Fielding though. That's why it's always good to know whether the backend team knows about the principles of REST when creating their APIs and their delta between RESTful and RESTish. I've been working with "REST APIs" which had unnecessary nestings of resources, obscure naming conventions, and only HTTP GET/POST methods. Knowing about this before the onboarding on a project as a frontend developer is a good indication to avoid unnecessary struggles connecting your frontend to the backend.

Where do I find the API documentation? If you are working with GraphQL, the schema (which gets generated automatically) provides you everything you need as a freelance developer. In contrast, when working with REST, you need to align with the backend engineers on a communication channel for the API documentation. I have experienced all of it, while the last one would be one of the better cases:

API on demand on Slack by asking the backend developer(s)/team
API on Github by checking the backend GitHub repository
API on Swagger, et al.

While most of the backends that you will be working on are powered by REST, depending on the project there is a chance that you have other sources for your data such as GraphQL (e.g. custom Backend, Hasura), BaaS (e.g. Firebase), ABIs (e.g. Ethereum Smart Contract) that you need to be aware of.

FRONTEND CHECKLIST AS A REACT FREELANCER

As mentioned, it's always good to be a T-shaped frontend developer, because you can work on more things than only frontend. For example, if a client wants to see an MVP from you, you will be most likely responsible for more than just React. In my case, I had clients for which I had to set up an authentication service, configured the CI/CD, or had to wire their database into a GraphQL layer. So always gauge your degree of responsibilities in this new project.

Do you have already plans of which libraries you want to use? Whether this question comes up depends on whether the project will have a fresh start by having you as a frontend freelancer or whether the project is already in progress by having an in-house team working on it. In general, this question helps to narrow down the scope of the project.

In addition, most companies approaching me for an MVP already ask about what to use for their project in their initial email, so this gives you an opportunity to show that you know the React library ecosystem. In contrast, if a team is already working on the project, this question helps you to get to know the tech stack.

How much customization is needed? This is one of the most important questions for me, because whenever a client asks for the estimate of a fresh project, I always ask them whether they want to use off the shelf things (e.g. UI library) or build their own (e.g. custom UI components). Spoiler: Most companies do not want to spend their budget for custom UI components -- because this is often a monthly project in itself -- however, I had a case where this was indeed a requirement.

Personal recommendation: Try to build a UI library once for a client which has the budget and the requirements for it, because it's a great learning experience for you as a React developer. However, after you have done it once, you can put a checkmark next to this experience. I have done it myself.

In the case of UI libraries, the go-to UI library in React is Material UI these days. The client has to decide whether it's worth it to use a library with a common look and feel (if there is not much budget to customize it). In addition, if the client hires a team of frontend freelancers, where most developers are junior developers, most likely they will have used Material UI before and will be productive from the start. In contrast, choosing a not as popular library like Chakra UI gives your project a more special character and many freelancers something new to explore.

But it doesn't end here with customization. Another popular topic are visualizations and charts in React. If the client you are going to work for intends to use these kind of things, you should really try to narrow down their requirements here and evaluate these with the different charting libraries that are out there, because this can minimize the workload tremendously by avoiding customizations or using D3 as low-level charting library from the start.

There is always potential for discussion beyond the UI and charting libraries. Other common questions are: Are we using a state management library?, How do we fetch data?, and Should we use TypeScript?.

It's also worth to note that several of the companies I am working with approach me with a license to a closed source React library. I try my best to get them off this path, because my experiences working with a closed source libraries are not the best and as a freelancer I would rather want to extend my knowledge working with commonly used open source libraries.

Last but not least, even though every developer knows it should be done, is the question: How much should be tested? By asking how much you show the intend that you want to test, however, I have been working with several companies which saw testing as an afterthought and rather wanted to complete the project upon deadline. So it really depends on the client you are working with.

In conclusion, I hope this extensive checklist for frontend freelancers helps you to hire a React freelancer as a company, to land a job as a React freelancer, or just to improve the onboarding experience for both parties.

Huawei President in charge of Autopilot Development: Cars will never be fully autonomous

If the head of Tesla believes that the autopilot of the fifth level (L5) will soon be implemented in cars, then Su Qing, president and chief architect of Huawei ADS Intelligent Driving solutions, is not ready to agree with him. The company’s top manager and head of the autopilot systems division spoke about this at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference.

The L5 level of autonomous driving will never be reached. Mainly because the definition of the L5 level of autonomous driving covers all scenarios anytime, anywhere and in any weather, no human driver can handle it, so neither can a car be able to handle it.

Su Cin, Huawei

So far, the most advanced autonomous driving systems have reached Level 4, but mostly under experimental conditions. And in real life, you can count on a maximum of the third level: the driver may not keep his hands on the steering wheel, but still must monitor the traffic situation. Most production cars are equipped with systems of the first and second levels, which, in fact, are just various assistants and active cruise control.

Some manufacturers promise to introduce commercial systems of the fourth level, but so far this is a long way off. For example, Honda promises a production car with L4 autopilot only by 2026. Well, Tesla, Lyft, Uber and Google (Waymo) have advanced farthest in this matter.

Understand the Concepts, Techniques and Mathematical Frameworks Used by Experts in Machine Learning

ABOUT THIS COURSE

Bloomberg presents "Foundations of Machine Learning," a training course that was initially delivered internally to the company's software engineers as part of its "Machine Learning EDU" initiative. This course covers a wide variety of topics in machine learning and statistical modeling. The primary goal of the class is to help participants gain a deep understanding of the concepts, techniques and mathematical frameworks used by experts in machine learning. It is designed to make valuable machine learning skills more accessible to individuals with a strong math background, including software developers, experimental scientists, engineers and financial professionals.

The 30 lectures in the course are embedded below, but may also be viewed in this YouTube playlist. The course includes a complete set of homework assignments, each containing a theoretical element and implementation challenge with support code in Python, which is rapidly becoming the prevailing programming language for data science and machine learning in both academia and industry. This course also serves as a foundation on which more specialized courses and further independent study can build.

Please fill out this short online form to register for access to our course's Piazza discussion board. Applications are processed manually, so please be patient. You should receive an email directly from Piazza when you are registered. Common questions from this and previous editions of the course are posted in our FAQ.

The first lecture, Black Box Machine Learning, gives a quick start introduction to practical machine learning and only requires familiarity with basic programming concepts.

PREREQUISITES

The quickest way to see if the mathematics level of the course is for you is to take a look at this mathematics assessment, which is a preview of some of the math concepts that show up in the first part of the course.

Solid mathematical background, equivalent to a 1-semester undergraduate course in each of the following: linear algebra, multivariate differential calculus, probability theory, and statistics. The content of NYU's DS-GA-1002: Statistical and Mathematical Methods would be more than sufficient, for example.
Python programming required for most homework assignments.
Recommended: At least one advanced, proof-based mathematics course
Recommended: Computer science background up to a "data structures and algorithms" course

1. BLACK BOX MACHINE LEARNING

With the abundance of well-documented machine learning (ML) libraries, programmers can now "do" some ML, without any understanding of how things are working. And we'll encourage such "black box" machine learning... just so long as you follow the procedures described in this lecture. To make proper use of ML libraries, you need to be conversant in the basic vocabulary, concepts, and workflows that underlie ML. We'll introduce the standard ML problem types (classification and regression) and discuss prediction functions, feature extraction, learning algorithms, performance evaluation, cross-validation, sample bias, nonstationarity, overfitting, and hyperparameter tuning.

If you're already familiar with standard machine learning practice, you can skip this lecture.

2. CASE STUDY: CHURN PREDICTION

We have an interactive discussion about how to reformulate a real and subtly complicated business problem as a formal machine learning problem. The real goal isn't so much to solve the problem, as to convey the point that properly mapping your business problem to a machine learning problem is both extremely important and often quite challenging. This course doesn't dwell on how to do this mapping, though see Provost and Fawcett's book in the references.

3. INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICAL LEARNING THEORY
This is where our "deep study" of machine learning begins. We introduce some of the core building blocks and concepts that we will use throughout the remainder of this course: input space, action space, outcome space, prediction functions, loss functions, and hypothesis spaces. We present our first machine learning method: empirical risk minimization. We also highlight the issue of overfitting, which may occur when we find the empirical risk minimizer over too large a hypothesis space.

4. STOCHASTIC GRADIENT DESCENT
A recurring theme in machine learning is that we formulate learning problems as optimization problems. Empirical risk minimization was our first example of this. To do learning, we need to do optimization. In this lecture we cover stochastic gradient descent, which is today's standard optimization method for large-scale machine learning problems.

5. EXCESS RISK DECOMPOSITION
We introduce the notions of approximation error, estimation error, and optimization error. While these concepts usually show up in more advanced courses, they will help us frame our understanding of the tradeoffs between hypothesis space choice, data set size, and optimization run times. In particular, these concepts will help us understand why "better" optimization methods (such as quasi-Newton methods) may not find prediction functions that generalize better, despite finding better optima.

6. L1 AND L2 REGULARIZATION

We introduce "regularization", our main defense against overfitting. We discuss the equivalence of the penalization and constraint forms of regularization (see Hwk 4 Problem 8), and we introduce L1 and L2 regularization, the two most important forms of regularization for linear models. When L1 and L2 regularization are applied to linear least squares, we get "lasso" and "ridge" regression, respectively. We compare the "regularization paths" for lasso and ridge regression, and give a geometric argument for why lasso often gives "sparse" solutions. Finally, we present "coordinate descent", our second major approach to optimization. When applied to the lasso objective function, coordinate descent takes a particularly clean form and is known as the "shooting algorithm".

7. LASSO, RIDGE, AND ELASTIC NET

We continue our discussion of ridge and lasso regression by focusing on the case of correlated features, which is a common occurrence in machine learning practice. We will see that ridge solutions tend to spread weight equally among highly correlated features, while lasso solutions may be unstable in the case of highly correlated features. Finally, we introduce the "elastic net", a combination of L1 and L2 regularization, which ameliorates the instability of L1 while still allowing for sparsity in the solution.

8. LOSS FUNCTIONS FOR REGRESSION AND CLASSIFICATION
We start by discussing absolute loss and Huber loss. We consider them as alternatives to the square loss that are more robust to outliers. Next, we introduce our approach to the classification setting, introducing the notions of score, margin, and margin-based loss functions. We discuss basic properties of the hinge loss (i.e SVM loss), logistic loss, and the square loss, considered as margin-based losses. The interplay between the loss function we use for training and the properties of the prediction function we end up with is a theme we will return to several times during the course.

9. LAGRANGIAN DUALITY AND CONVEX OPTIMIZATION

We introduce the basics of convex optimization and Lagrangian duality. We discuss weak and strong duality, Slater's constraint qualifications, and we derive the complementary slackness conditions. As far as this course is concerned, there are really only two reasons for discussing Lagrangian duality: 1) The complementary slackness conditions will imply that SVM solutions are "sparse in the data" (next lecture), which has important practical implications for the kernelized SVMs (see the kernel methods lecture). 2) Strong duality is a sufficient condition for the equivalence between the penalty and constraint forms of regularization (see Hwk 4 Problem 8).

This mathematically intense lecture may be safely skipped.

10. SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES

We define the soft-margin support vector machine (SVM) directly in terms of its objective function (L2-regularized, hinge loss minimization over a linear hypothesis space). Using our knowledge of Lagrangian duality, we find a dual form of the SVM problem, apply the complementary slackness conditions, and derive some interesting insights into the connection between "support vectors" and margin. Read the "SVM Insights from Duality" in the Notes below for a high-level view of this mathematically dense lecture.

11. SUBGRADIENT DESCENT

Neither the lasso nor the SVM objective function is differentiable, and we had to do some work for each to optimize with gradient-based methods. It turns out, however, that gradient descent will essentially work in these situations, so long as you're careful about handling the non-differentiable points. To this end, we introduce "subgradient descent", and we show the surprising result that, even though the objective value may not decrease with each step, every step brings us closer to the minimizer.

This mathematically intense lecture may be safely skipped.

12. FEATURE EXTRACTION

13. KERNEL METHODS

With linear methods, we may need a whole lot of features to get a hypothesis space that's expressive enough to fit our data -- there can be orders of magnitude more features than training examples. While regularization can control overfitting, having a huge number of features can make things computationally very difficult, if handled naively. For objective functions of a particular general form, which includes ridge regression and SVMs but not lasso regression, we can "kernelize", which can allow significant speedups in certain situations. In fact, with the "kernel trick", we can even use an infinite-dimensional feature space at a computational cost that depends primarily on the training set size.

14. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

This is our second "black-box" machine learning lecture. We start by discussing various models that you should almost always build for your data, to use as baselines and performance sanity checks. From there we focus primarily on evaluating classifier performance. We define a whole slew of performance statistics used in practice (precision, recall, F1, etc.). We also discuss the fact that most classifiers provide a numeric score, and if you need to make a hard classification, you should tune your threshold to optimize the performance metric of importance to you, rather than just using the default (typically 0 or 0.5). We also discuss the various performance curves you'll see in practice: precision/recall, ROC, and (my personal favorite) lift curves.

15. "CITYSENSE": PROBABILISTIC MODELING FOR UNUSUAL BEHAVIOR DETECTION

So far we have studied the regression setting, for which our predictions (i.e. "actions") are real-valued, as well as the classification setting, for which our score functions also produce real values. With this lecture, we begin our consideration of "conditional probability models", in which the predictions are probability distributions over possible outcomes. We motivate these models by discussion of the "CitySense" problem, in which we want to predict the probability distribution for the number of taxicab dropoffs at each street corner, at different times of the week. Given this model, we can then determine, in real-time, how "unusual" the amount of behavior is at various parts of the city, and thereby help you find the secret parties, which is of course the ultimate goal of machine learning.

16. MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION
In empirical risk minimization, we minimize the average loss on a training set. If our prediction functions are producing probability distributions, what loss functions will give reasonable performance measures? In this lecture, we discuss "likelihood", one of the most popular performance measures for distributions. We temporarily leave aside the conditional probability modeling problem, and focus on the simpler problem of fitting an unconditional probability model to data. We can use "maximum likelihood" to fit both parametric and nonparametric models. Once we have developed a collection of candidate probability distributions on training data, we select the best one by choosing the model that has highest "hold-out likelihood", i.e. likelihood on validation data.

17. CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY MODELS
In this lecture we consider prediction functions that produce distributions from a parametric family of distributions. We restrict to the case of linear models, though later in the course we will show how to make nonlinear versions using gradient boosting and neural networks. We develop the technique through four examples: Bernoulli regression (logistic regression being a special case), Poisson regression, Gaussian regression, and multinomial logistic regression (our first multiclass method). We conclude by connecting this maximum likelihood framework back to our empirical risk minimization framework.

18. BAYESIAN METHODS

We review some basics of classical and Bayesian statistics. For classical "frequentist" statistics, we define statistics and point estimators, and discuss various desirable properties of point estimators. For Bayesian statistics, we introduce the "prior distribution", which is a distribution on the parameter space that you declare before seeing any data. We compare the two approaches for the simple problem of learning about a coin's probability of heads. Along the way, we discuss conjugate priors, posterior distributions, and credible sets. Finally, we give the basic setup for Bayesian decision theory, which is how a Bayesian would go from a posterior distribution to choosing an action.

19. BAYESIAN CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY MODELS

In our earlier discussion of conditional probability modeling, we started with a hypothesis space of conditional probability models, and we selected a single conditional probability model using maximum likelihood or regularized maximum likelihood. In the Bayesian approach, we start with a prior distribution on this hypothesis space, and after observing some training data, we end up with a posterior distribution on the hypothesis space. For making conditional probability predictions, we can derive a predictive distribution from the posterior distribution. We explore these concepts by working through the case of Bayesian Gaussian linear regression. We also make a precise connection between MAP estimation in this model and ridge regression.

20. CLASSIFICATION AND REGRESSION TREES
We begin our discussion of nonlinear models with tree models. We first describe the hypothesis space of decision trees, and we discuss some complexity measures we can use for regularization, including tree depth and the number of leaf nodes. The challenge starts when we try to find the regularized empirical risk minimizer (ERM) over this space for some loss function. It turns out finding this ERM is computationally intractable. We discuss a standard greedy approach to tree building, both for classification and regression, in the case that features take values in any ordered set. We also describe an approach for handling categorical variables (in the binary classification case) and missing values.

22. BAGGING AND RANDOM FORESTS

We motivate bagging as follows: Consider the regression case, and suppose we could create a bunch of prediction functions, say B of them, based on B independent training samples of size n. If we average together these prediction functions, the expected value of the average is the same as any one of the functions, but the variance would have decreased by a factor of 1/B -- a clear win! Of course, this would require an overall sample of size nB. The idea of bagging is to replace independent samples with bootstrap samples from a single data set of size n. Of course, the bootstrap samples are not independent, so much of our discussion is about when bagging does and does not lead to improved performance. Random forests were invented as a way to create conditions in which bagging works better.

23. GRADIENT BOOSTING

Gradient boosting is an approach to "adaptive basis function modeling", in which we learn a linear combination of M basis functions, which are themselves learned from a base hypothesis space H. Gradient boosting may be used with any subdifferentiable loss function and over any base hypothesis space on which we can do regression. Regression trees are the most commonly used base hypothesis space. It is important to note that the "regression" in "gradient boosted regression trees" (GBRTs) refers to how we fit the basis functions, not the overall loss function. GBRTs are routinely used for classification and conditional probability modeling. They are among the most dominant methods in competitive machine learning (e.g. Kaggle competitions).

24. MULTICLASS AND INTRODUCTION TO STRUCTURED PREDICTION
Here we consider how to generalize the score-producing binary classification methods we've discussed (e.g. SVM and logistic regression) to multiclass settings. We start by discussing "One-vs-All", a simple reduction of multiclass to binary classification. This usually works just fine in practice, despite the interesting failure case we illustrate. However, One-vs-All doesn't scale to a very large number of classes, since we have to train a separate model for each class. This is the real motivation for presenting the "compatibility function" approach described in this lecture. The approach presented here extends to structured prediction problems, where the output space may be exponentially large. We didn't have time to define structured prediction in the lecture, but please see the slides and the SSBD book in the references.

Here we start our short unit on unsupervised learning. k-means clustering is presented first as an algorithm and then as an approach to minimizing a particular objective function. One challenge with clustering algorithms is that it's not obvious how to measure success. (See Section 22.5 of the SSBD book for a nice discussion.) When possible, I prefer to take a probabilistic modeling approach, as discussed in the next two lectures.

26. GAUSSIAN MIXTURE MODELS
A Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is a family of multimodal probability distributions, which is a plausible generative model for clustered data. We can fit this model using maximum likelihood, and we can assess the quality of fit by evaluating the model likelihood on holdout data. While the "learning" phase of Gaussian mixture modeling is fitting the model to data, in the "inference" phase, we determine for any point drawn from the GMM the probability that it came from each of the k components. To use a GMM for clustering, we simply assign each point to the component that it is most likely to have come from. k-means clustering can be seen as a limiting case of a restricted form of Gaussian mixture modeling.

27. EM ALGORITHM FOR LATENT VARIABLE MODELS
It turns out, fitting a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) by maximum likelihood is easier said than done: there is no closed form solution, and our usual gradient methods do not work well. The standard approach to maximum likelihood estimation in a Gaussian mixture model is the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. In this lecture, we present the EM algorithm for a general latent variable model, of which GMM is a special case. We present the EM algorithm as a very basic "variational method" and indicate a few generalizations.

In the context of this course, we view neural networks as "just" another nonlinear hypothesis space. On the practical side, unlike trees and tree-based ensembles (our other major nonlinear hypothesis spaces), neural networks can be fit using gradient-based optimization methods. On the theoretical side, a large enough neural network can approximate any continuous function. We discuss the specific case of the multilayer perceptron for multiclass classification, which we view as a generalization of multinomial logistic regression from linear to nonlinear score functions.

29. BACKPROPAGATION AND THE CHAIN RULE

Neural network optimization is amenable to gradient-based methods, but if the actual computation of the gradient is done naively, the computational cost can be prohibitive. Backpropagation is the standard algorithm for computing the gradient efficiently. We present the backpropagation algorithm for a general computation graph. The algorithm we present applies, without change, to models with "parameter tying", which include convolutional networks and recurrent neural networks (RNN's), the workhorses of modern computer vision and natural language processing. We illustrate backpropagation with one of the simplest models with parameter tying: regularized linear regression. Backpropagation for the multilayer perceptron, the standard introductory example, is presented in detail in Hwk 7 Problem 4.

Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition (Aurélien Géron)
This is a practical guide to machine learning that corresponds fairly well with the content and level of our course. While most of our homework is about coding ML from scratch with numpy, this book makes heavy use of scikit-learn and TensorFlow. We'll use the first two chapters of this book in the first two weeks of the course, when we cover "black-box machine learning." It'll also be a handy reference for your projects and beyond this course, when you'll want to make use of existing ML packages, rather than rolling your own.
The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Friedman, and Tibshirani)
This will be our main textbook for L1 and L2 regularization, trees, bagging, random forests, and boosting. It's written by three statisticians who invented many of the techniques discussed. There's an easier version of this book that covers many of the same topics, described below. (Available for free as a PDF.)
An Introduction to Statistical Learning (James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani)
This book is written by two of the same authors as The Elements of Statistical Learning. It's much less intense mathematically, and it's good for a lighter introduction to the topics. Uses R as the language of instruction. (Available for free as a PDF.)
Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms (Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David)
This is our primary reference for kernel methods and multiclass classification, and possibly more towards the end of the course. Covers a lot of theory that we don't go into, but it would be a good supplemental resource for a more theoretical course, such as Mohri's Foundations of Machine Learning course. (Available for free as a PDF.)
Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Christopher Bishop)
Our primary reference for probabilistic methods, including bayesian regression, latent variable models, and the EM algorithm. It's highly recommended, but unfortunately not free online.
Data Science for Business (Provost and Fawcett)
Ideally, this would be everybody's first book on machine learning. The intended audience is both the ML practitioner and the ML product manager. It's full of important core concepts and practical wisdom. The math is so minimal that it's perfect for reading on your phone, and I encourage you to read it in parallel to doing this class. Have your managers read it too.

Hong Kong Star Jackie Chan Wants To Join the Chinese Communist Party

Hong Kong star Jackie Chan declares his admiration for the Chinese Communist Party at a symposium, as well as a wish to join its ranks.

BY NARAYAN LIU
PUBLISHED 49 MINUTES AGO

Head of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping gave a speech celebrating the Chinese Communist Party's centennial on July 1. That speech was the subject of a symposium attended by some of China's most prolific film insiders, including Jackie Chan.

Chan took the opportunity to express his admiration of the CCP and a desire to join its ranks. Addressing party members, the Hong Kong action star stated (translated from Mandarin), "I'm jealous that you are CCP members. The CCP is really great." He continued, "The CCP's promises don't take 100 years, they are fulfilled in decades." He then declared, "I want to be a CCP member."

Chan was born in Hong Kong and is known for his martial arts films and his signature slapstick martial arts style. However, despite worldwide popularity, Chan has been a controversial figure in Hong Kong, predominately for his pro-CCP views and attitudes. While he has never been a member, Chan has actively participated in CCP initiatives and nationalist projects.

During the 2019 Hong Kong protests, for example, Chan took part in a media campaign named "The Five-starred Red Flag Has 1.4 Billion Flag Guards," aimed at promoting nationalism during the protests in Hong Kong which were believed to incite and encourage separatist sentiments. During a television appearance in China at the time, Chan stated, "I feel the pride of being a Chinese everywhere, the Five-starred Red Flag is respected worldwide." This was followed by what many in Hong Kong interpreted as a warning aimed at the special administrative region: "I also feel that safety, stability and peace are like fresh air. You never know how precious it is until you lose it."

The Chinese Communist Party was founded on July 1, 1921 and currently has approximately 91 million members, according to a 2020 census. The party has come under intense scrutiny over the course of the past decade owing to its human rights atrocities as well as its increasingly aggressive approach toward diplomacy, referred to informally as Wolf Warrior tactics.

Among these human rights violations are what is recognized as genocide of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, the erosion of democracy and implementation of a draconian national security law in Hong Kong, the cultural erasure in Inner Mongolia, the occupation of Tibet, hostile behavior toward Taiwan, organ harvesting involving Falun Gong practitioners and more.

Cinema has been an important facet of the Communist Party's centennial celebrations. Theaters throughout China have been instructed to screen at least two propaganda films per week. These have been described as movies that "sing the praises of…and eulogize the Party, the motherland, its people and its heroes."

‘It feels like it’s 100 every single day’: Worsening heat alters life for inland California

Anthony Wainscott has known his share of hardship, living the last two years on the streets of the Antelope Valley. But his personal misery index reached a new plateau during a weekend of record-setting heat.

“It’s extra hot. It’s abnormally hot,” said Wainscott, crouched in the meager shade of a palm tree on the edge of a shopping center parking lot Sunday in Palmdale, where the temperature hit 107 degrees. “I don’t even know how to explain it. But there’s something extra playing with the environment right now. And it’s not good.”

The 33-year-old Massachusetts native accepted the occasional donation from drivers, who briefly rolled down their windows to offer some change or a dollar or two. He used a dwindling supply of bottled water to fill a dish for his panting pit bull, Roscoe.

A few businesses would let Wainscott and Roscoe in for a few minutes to cool down, but he found many people’s patience wearing thin, so he spent most of the unbearable day outdoors.

“Nighttime is the only break we get,” he said. “And even then it’s way too hot.”

Like many other California cities, Palmdale saw record temperatures on Saturday — reaching 112 degrees, surpassing the previous daily high of 109 in 2003, according to preliminary figures from the National Weather Service.

Palm Springs saw a high of 111 degrees on Sunday, but that was down from Saturday’s peak of 120, which broke the previous record for July 10. Also on Sunday, the temperature hit 110 in Lancaster, 101 in Acton and 91 in Riverside. Though coastal areas remained in the 70s and 80s, humidity levels throughout the region brought their own discomfort.

Forecasters attributed the heat wave to an exceptionally large, exceptionally strong area of high pressure hovering over the California-Nevada border that sent temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above normal.

Although such events are fairly typical for this time of year, scientists say they are becoming more frequent and intense as global temperatures rise due to human-caused climate change.

“One hundred twenty degrees in Palm Springs, that’s not normal,” said Ivory Small, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in San Diego. “So you can tell there’s a big high [pressure system] out there.”

The Eastern Sierra city of Bishop on Saturday recorded its hottest temperature ever, 111 degrees, breaking the record of 110 set in 2002. So did Barstow-Daggett Airport in San Bernardino County, although its high of 118 was previously measured twice before, in 1994 and 2007.

Palm Springs reached 120 and Borrego hit 117, topping the respective records of 119 and 116 set on July 10, 2012. Lancaster hit 113, breaking the daily record of 112 set in 1961; Merced Regional Airport reached 111 degrees, breaking the 1961 record of 108; and Needles reached 122, breaking the 2003 record of 121.

Daily records were tied in Paso Robles, Hanford, Sandberg and South Lake Tahoe, which hit 114, 112, 98 and 93 degrees, respectively.

Sunday was shaping up to be hotter in some areas, with even lifelong residents of the high desert saying the heat seemed abnormal.

Jody Clark, 52, had to take his mother to urgent care when her blood pressure dipped to a dangerous low. She was convinced that the high temperatures were throwing her body off, even inside her air-conditioned home.

“This is as hot as it’s been in a long time,” said Clark, who has lived in the Antelope Valley his entire life. “Now it feels like it’s 100 every single day.”

He’s thinking of moving his mother out of the area, partly to beat the heat. To Texas.

Temperatures of 110 or higher sent huge crowds to pools and water parks. Signs were up by midday declaring the DryTown Water Park in Palmdale sold out for the day. The city-run facility provided a refuge for about 1,500 people over the course of the day.

Visiting DryTown with an extended family group, Marcus Guerrero said he has heard that the temperatures were supposed to be more bearable because of the low humidity.

“People complain about the humidity, but I would take that over this,” said Guerrero, a singer and trumpet player in a mariachi band. “The winters seem to get shorter and shorter and the summers hotter and hotter.”

But Sunday’s conditions were actually more humid than normal because of monsoonal moisture working its way up from the Gulf of California, said Kathy Hoxsie, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard. That allows for less overnight cooling and makes it feel more oppressive, she said.

“What people are probably feeling is not just a little warmer but a little muggy,” she said.

Here, residents tend to feel the humidity once it tops 35%, as it had done in many areas by Sunday afternoon, or even 20% in desert areas.

Still, the conditions were nothing like what people experience in other parts of the country, where the humidity can easily reach 85% to 90% this time of year, Hoxsie said.

“Folks in the South and the East would pretty much laugh at us if we called it humid,” she said.

Although things were expected to start gradually cooling off Monday and Tuesday, the high-pressure system was slow-moving and so forecasters were calling for elevated temperatures to stick around for at least the next week and a half.

Jenni Parra, cooling off under an awning at the water park, said it feels as though the summer goes on without end.

“Now, I expect it to start getting hot by halfway through March. And then it stays hot all the way through … like October or November,” Parra said. “There’s no way you need a jacket, even at Thanksgiving.”

Parra, who grew up on California’s Central Coast, said the heat seemed to be affecting everything, even causing balky service on her cellphone. To her, there is no reasonable explanation other than climate change. She figures it would have been over 100 on past July days in the Antelope Valley, but she blamed the extra “six or seven degrees” on the warming planet.

“To me, it’s the big companies, like the power companies, that are not willing to do something about it,” said Parra, 31, a mother of five. “It’s time to change, to find renewable resources and actually develop them, even if they are not going to make the same profit. That’s the problem: They want the profit for themselves over the profit of all the people.”

The heat wave and a massive wildfire in southern Oregon that knocked out transmission lines combined to put a strain on California’s energy supply.

The California Independent System Operator, which runs the electrical grid for most of the state, said it was calling for power plants to delay any planned maintenance due to a projected increase in demand Monday and warned residents they might be asked to conserve power in an attempt to avoid outages.

In a bid to free up additional energy capacity, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday signed an executive order allowing the emergency use of auxiliary ship engines to relieve pressure on the state’s electric grid, according to a statement.

Northern California wildfire grows, destroys homes amid extreme conditions

July 11, 2021

In Northern California, the extreme heat, combined with an uptick in afternoon winds, was complicating efforts to control a wildfire that had already grown into the state’s largest of the season so far.

Authorities received reports that the Sugar fire had destroyed homes in multiple communities, but no official figures have been released, said Lisa Cox, a public information officer.

The fire, which ignited July 2, had spread to 83,256 acres as of Sunday morning and remained at 8% contained. It was one of two sparked by lightning in the Plumas National Forest that have together been dubbed the Beckwourth Complex. The other, the Dotta fire, started June 30 and was 670 acres and 99% contained by early Sunday.

Despite firefighters’ best efforts, the Sugar fire grew by more than 22,000 acres from Saturday into Sunday as it continued to behave erratically, at one point forming a fire whirl as it backed down an escarpment near the southern end of Constantia Road, Cox said.

“It’s really taken off,” she said. “I have to look at the numbers again because my eyes, it’s a lot to take in.”

Firefighters were being instructed to take frequent breaks and hydrate as an excessive heat warning from the National Weather Service was extended through Tuesday.

Fire officials have said that rising temperatures and drought have combined to wring moisture from vegetation, leading to environments that more closely resemble the peak of the fire season than mid-July.

“Right now we’re like two months ahead of schedule,” Cox said. “So we’re seeing fire behavior that normally happens in September.”

TikTok has opened its first pop-up venue in the UK, allowing fans to interact with influencers who have found success via the social media app and try to create their own mini-films.

The app, which allows users to create and share short videos soundtracked with music, has partnered with the Westfield shopping centre in west London to create the first TikTok For You House. The design of the pop-up venue, which will be open until 8 August, is inspired by TikTok’s homepage, which highlights trending clips.

Sign up to TechScape, Alex Hern's weekly tech newsletter, starting 14 July.

Influencers including British teenager Kyle Thomas, comedian Ehiz Ufuah, chef Poppy O’Toole and freestyle footballers Jeremy Lynch and Ben Black, will offer £5 sessions explaining how to make content for TikTok. Sessions will also be available for parents to learn how to keep teenagers safe on the platform.

Wannabe TikTok stars will also be able book free sessions to use the venue to create their own films. The venue will feature several rooms that can provide different backdrops including a kitchen, which will showcase viral recipes and cook-offs. A dressing room will host beauty, fashion and transformation challenges.

The pop-up will not be selling products like a traditional shop, though those attending events will be given free TikTok merchandise.

The opening of the venue comes as shopping centres and high streets look for ways to entice consumers away from their sofas and digital entertainment, which has soared in popularity during the Covid-19 pandemic, and back towards real-life experiences.

TikTok, Instagram and other social media platforms have become increasingly influential with consumers, helping to drive where and what they buy, and physical space enables them to open up the platforms to new potential users.

Harita Shah, the marketing director for UK events at Westfield’s parent company Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, said: “TikTok has become a cultural phenomenon. It’s where many of our visitors are getting their inspiration from, whether that’s fashion trends, the newest home styling influencer or foodie fads.

“Having a physical space at Westfield London gives TikTok the chance to immerse shoppers and new creators in full 360 experience where the best of the online platform merges with a real-life experience.”

This document is intended to give you a quick overview of the Raku programming language.
For those new to Raku, it should get you up and running.

Some sections of this document refer to other (more complete and accurate) parts of the Raku documentation. You should read them if you need more information on a specific subject.

Throughout this document, you will find examples for most discussed topics. To better understand them, take the time to reproduce all examples.

1. Introduction
1.1. What is Raku

Raku is a high-level, general-purpose, gradually typed language. Raku is multi-paradigmatic. It supports Procedural, Object Oriented, and Functional programming.

Raku motto:

TMTOWTDI (Pronounced Tim Toady): There is more than one way to do it.

1.2. Jargon

Raku: Is a language specification with a test suite. Implementations that pass the specification test suite are considered Raku.

Rakudo: Is a compiler for Raku.

Zef: Is a Raku module installer.

Rakudo Star: Is a bundle that includes Rakudo, Zef, a collection of Raku modules, and documentation.

1.3. Installing Raku
Linux

To install Rakudo Star, run the following commands from your terminal:

wget https://rakudo.org/downloads/star/rakudo-star-2020.10.tar.gz
tar xfz rakudo-star-2020.10.tar.gz
cd rakudo-star-2020.10
perl Configure.pl --gen-moar --make-install --prefix ~/rakudo

For other options, go to https://rakudo.org/star/source

macOS

Four options are available:

Follow the same steps listed for installing on Linux

Install with homebrew: brew install rakudo-star

Install with MacPorts: sudo port install rakudo

Get the latest installer (file with .dmg extension) from https://rakudo.org/latest/star/macos

Windows

For 64-bit architectures: Get the latest installer (file with .msi extension) from https://rakudo.org/latest/star/win

After installation, make sure C:\rakudo\bin is in the PATH

Docker

Get the official Docker image docker pull rakudo-star

Then run a container with the image docker run -it rakudo-star

1.4. Running Raku code

Running Raku code can be done using the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop). To do this, open a terminal, type raku into the terminal window, and hit [Enter]. This will cause a prompt of > to appear. Next, type a line of code and hit [Enter]. The REPL will print out the value of the line. You may then type another line, or type exit and hit [Enter] to leave the REPL.

Alternatively, write your code in a file, save it and run it. It is recommended that Raku scripts have a .raku file name extension. Run the file by typing raku filename.raku into the terminal window and hitting [Enter]. Unlike the REPL, this will not automatically print the result of each line: the code must contain a statement like say to print output.

The REPL is mostly used for trying a specific piece of code, typically a single line. For programs with more than a single line it is recommended to store them in a file and then run them.

Single lines may also be tried non-interactively on the command-line by typing raku -e 'your code here' and hitting [Enter].

	

Rakudo Star bundles a line editor that helps you get the most out of the REPL.

If you installed plain Rakudo instead of Rakudo Star then you probably don’t have line editing features enabled (using the up and down arrows for history, left and right to edit input, TAB completion). Consider running the following command and you shall be all set:

zef install Linenoise would work on Windows, Linux and macOS

zef install Readline if you are on Linux and prefer the Readline library

1.5. Editors

Since most of the time we will be writing and storing our Raku programs in files, we should have a decent text editor that recognizes Raku syntax.

I personally use and recommend Atom. It is a modern text editor and comes with Raku syntax highlighting out of the box. Perl 6 FE is an alternative Raku syntax highlighter for Atom, derived from the original package but with many bug fixes and additions.

Other people in the community also use Vim, Emacs or Padre.

Recent versions of Vim ship with syntax highlighting out of the box. Emacs and Padre will require installation of additional packages.

1.6. Hello World!

We shall begin with The hello world ritual.

say 'hello world';

that can also be written as:

'hello world'.say;
1.7. Syntax overview

Raku is free form: Most of the time you are free to use any amount of whitespace, although in certain cases whitespace carries meaning.

Statements are typically a logical line of code, they need to end with a semicolon: say "Hello" if True;

Expressions are a special type of statement that returns a value: 1+2 will return 3

Expressions are made of Terms and Operators.

Terms are:

Variables: A value that can be manipulated and changed.

Literals: A constant value like a number or a string.

Operators are classified into types:

Type

	

Explanation

	

Example




Prefix

	

Before the term.

	

++1




Infix

	

Between terms

	

1+2




Postfix

	

After the term

	

1++




Circumfix

	

Around the term

	

(1)




Postcircumfix

	

After one term, around another

	

Array[1]

1.7.1. Identifiers

Identifiers are the names given to terms when you define them.

Rules:

They must start with an alphabetic character or an underscore.

They can contain digits (except the first character).

They can contain dashes or apostrophes (except the first and last character), provided there’s an alphabetic character to the right side of each dash or apostrophe.

Valid

	

Invalid




var1

	

1var




var-one

	

var-1




var’one

	

var'1




var1_

	

var1'




_var

	

-var

Naming conventions:

Camel case: variableNo1

Kebab case: variable-no1

Snake case: variable_no1

You are free to name your identifiers as you like, but it is good practice to adopt one naming convention consistently.

Using meaningful names will ease your (and other’s) programming life.

var1 = var2 * var3 is syntactically correct but its purpose is not evident.

monthly-salary = daily-rate * working-days would be a better way to name your variables.

1.7.2. Comments

A comment is text ignored by the compiler and used as a note.

Comments are divided into 3 types:

Single line:

# This is a single line comment

Embedded:

say #`(This is an embedded comment) "Hello World."

Multi line:

=begin comment
This is a multi line comment.
Comment 1
Comment 2
=end comment
1.7.3. Quotes

Strings need to be delimited by either double quotes or single quotes.

Always use double quotes:

if your string contains an apostrophe.

if your string contains a variable that needs to be interpolated.

say 'Hello World';   # Hello World
say "Hello World";   # Hello World
say "Don't";         # Don't
my $name = 'John Doe';
say 'Hello $name';   # Hello $name
say "Hello $name";   # Hello John Doe

3. Variables

Raku variables are classified into 3 categories: Scalars, Arrays and Hashes.

A sigil (Sign in Latin) is a character that is used as a prefix to categorize variables.

$ is used for scalars

@ is used for arrays

% is used for hashes

3.1. Scalars

A scalar holds one value or reference.

# String
my $name = 'John Doe';
say $name;

# Integer
my $age = 99;
say $age;

A specific set of operations can be performed on a scalar, depending on the value it holds.

String
my $name = 'John Doe';
say $name.uc;
say $name.chars;
say $name.flip;
JOHN DOE

eoD nhoJ
	For the complete list of methods applicable to Strings, see https://docs.raku.org/type/Str
Integer
my $age = 17;
say $age.is-prime;
True
	For the complete list of methods applicable to Integers, see https://docs.raku.org/type/Int
Rational Number
my $age = 2.3;
say $age.numerator;
say $age.denominator;
say $age.nude;
23
10
(23 10)
	For the complete list of methods applicable to Rational Numbers, see https://docs.raku.org/type/Rat
3.2. Arrays

Arrays are lists containing multiple values.

my @animals = 'camel','llama','owl';
say @animals;

Many operations can be performed on arrays as shown in the below example:

	The tilde ~ is used for string concatenation.
Script
my @animals = 'camel','vicuña','llama';
say "The zoo contains " ~ @animals.elems ~ " animals";
say "The animals are: " ~ @animals;
say "I will adopt an owl for the zoo";
@animals.push("owl");
say "Now my zoo has: " ~ @animals;
say "The first animal we adopted was the " ~ @animals[0];
@animals.pop;
say "Unfortunately the owl got away and we're left with: " ~ @animals;
say "We're closing the zoo and keeping one animal only";
say "We're going to let go: " ~ @animals.splice(1,2) ~ " and keep the " ~ @animals;
Output
The zoo contains 3 animals
The animals are: camel vicuña llama
I will adopt an owl for the zoo
Now my zoo has: camel vicuña llama owl
The first animal we adopted was the camel
Unfortunately the owl got away and we're left with: camel vicuña llama
We're closing the zoo and keeping one animal only
We're going to let go: vicuña llama and keep the camel
Explanation

.elems returns the number of elements in an array.
.push() adds one or more elements to the array.
We can access a specific element in the array by specifying its position @animals[0].
.pop removes the last element from the array and returns it.
.splice(a,b) will remove b elements starting at position a.

3.2.1. Fixed-size arrays

A basic array is declared as following:

my @array;

The basic array can have indefinite length and thus is called auto-extending.
The array will accept any number of values with no restriction.

In contrast, we can also create fixed-size arrays.
These arrays cannot be accessed beyond their defined size.

To declare an array of fixed size, specify its maximum number of elements in square brackets immediately after its name:

my @array[3];

This array will be able to hold a maximum of 3 values, indexed from 0 to 2.

my @array[3];
@array[0] = "first value";
@array[1] = "second value";
@array[2] = "third value";

You will not be able to add a fourth value to this array:

my @array[3];
@array[0] = "first value";
@array[1] = "second value";
@array[2] = "third value";
@array[3] = "fourth value";
Index 3 for dimension 1 out of range (must be 0..2)
3.2.2. Multidimensional arrays

The arrays we saw until now are one-dimensional.
Fortunately, we can define multi-dimensional arrays in Raku.

my @tbl[3;2];

This array is two-dimensional. The first dimension can have a maximum of 3 values and the second dimension a maximum of 2 values.

Think of it as a 3x2 grid.

my @tbl[3;2];
@tbl[0;0] = 1;
@tbl[0;1] = "x";
@tbl[1;0] = 2;
@tbl[1;1] = "y";
@tbl[2;0] = 3;
@tbl[2;1] = "z";
say @tbl
[[1 x] [2 y] [3 z]]
Visual representation of the array:
[1 x]
[2 y]
[3 z]
	For the complete Array reference, see https://docs.raku.org/type/Array
3.3. Hashes
A Hash is a set of Key/Value pairs.
my %capitals = 'UK','London','Germany','Berlin';
say %capitals;
Another succinct way of filling the hash:
my %capitals = UK => 'London', Germany => 'Berlin';
say %capitals;

Some of the methods that can be called on hashes are:

Script
my %capitals = UK => 'London', Germany => 'Berlin';
%capitals.push: (France => 'Paris');
say %capitals.kv;
say %capitals.keys;
say %capitals.values;
say "The capital of France is: " ~ %capitals<France>;
Output
(France Paris Germany Berlin UK London)
(France Germany UK)
(Paris Berlin London)
The capital of France is: Paris
Explanation

.push: (key => 'Value') adds a new key/value pair.
.kv returns a list containing all keys and values.
.keys returns a list that contains all keys.
.values returns a list that contains all values.
We can access a specific value in the hash by specifying its key %hash<key>

	For the complete Hash reference, see https://docs.raku.org/type/Hash
3.4. Types

In the previous examples, we did not specify what type of values the variables should hold.

	.WHAT will return the type of value held in a variable.
my $var = 'Text';
say $var;
say $var.WHAT;

$var = 123;
say $var;
say $var.WHAT;

As you can see in the above example, the type of value in $var was once (Str) and then (Int).

This style of programming is called dynamic typing. Dynamic in the sense that variables may contain values of Any type.

Now try running the below example:
Notice Int before the variable name.

my Int $var = 'Text';
say $var;
say $var.WHAT;

It will fail and return this error message: Type check failed in assignment to $var; expected Int but got Str

What happened is that we specified beforehand that the variable should be of type (Int). When we tried to assign an (Str) to it, it failed.

This style of programming is called static typing. Static in the sense that variable types are defined before assignment and cannot change.

Raku is classified as gradually typed; it allows both static and dynamic typing.

Arrays and hashes can also be statically typed:
my Int @array = 1,2,3;
say @array;
say @array.WHAT;

my Str @multilingual = "Hello","Salut","Hallo","您好","안녕하세요","こんにちは";
say @multilingual;
say @multilingual.WHAT;

my Str %capitals = UK => 'London', Germany => 'Berlin';
say %capitals;
say %capitals.WHAT;

my Int %country-codes = UK => 44, Germany => 49;
say %country-codes;
say %country-codes.WHAT;
Below is a list of the most commonly used types:

You will most probably never use the first two but they are listed for informational purpose.

3.5. Introspection

Introspection is the process of getting information about an object properties like its type.
In one of the previous example we used .WHAT to return the type of the variable.

my Int $var;
say $var.WHAT;    # (Int)
my $var2;
say $var2.WHAT;   # (Any)
$var2 = 1;
say $var2.WHAT;   # (Int)
$var2 = "Hello";
say $var2.WHAT;   # (Str)
$var2 = True;
say $var2.WHAT;   # (Bool)
$var2 = Nil;
say $var2.WHAT;   # (Any)

The type of a variable holding a value is correlated to its value.
The type of a strongly declared empty variable is the type with which it was declared.
The type of an empty variable that wasn’t strongly declared is (Any)
To clear the value of a variable, assign Nil to it.

3.6. Scoping

Before using a variable for the first time, it needs to be declared.

Several declarators are used in Raku. We’ve been using my, so far.

my $var=1;

The my declarator give the variable lexical scope. In other words, the variable will only be accessible in the same block it was declared.

A block in Raku is delimited by { }. If no block is found, the variable will be available in the whole Raku script.

{
  my Str $var = 'Text';
  say $var;   # is accessible
}
say $var;   # is not accessible, returns an error

Since a variable is only accessible in the block where it is defined, the same variable name can be used in another block.

{
  my Str $var = 'Text';
  say $var;
}
my Int $var = 123;
say $var;
3.7. Assignment vs. Binding

We’ve seen in the previous examples, how to assign values to variables.
Assignment is done using the = operator.

my Int $var = 123;
say $var;

We can change the value assigned to a variable:

Assignment
my Int $var = 123;
say $var;
$var = 999;
say $var;
Output
123
999

On the other hand, we cannot change the value bound to a variable.
Binding is done using the := operator.

Binding
my Int $var := 123;
say $var;
$var = 999;
say $var;
Output
123
Cannot assign to an immutable value
Variables can also be bound to other variables:
my $a;
my $b;
$b := $a;
$a = 7;
say $b;
$b = 8;
say $a;
Output
7
8

Binding variables is bi-directional.
$a := $b and $b := $a have the same effect.

	For more info on variables, see https://docs.raku.org/language/variables
4. Functions and mutators

It is important to differentiate between functions and mutators.
Functions do not change the state of the object they were called on.
Mutators modify the state of the object.

Script
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
	
my @numbers = [7,2,4,9,11,3];

@numbers.push(99);
say @numbers;      #1

say @numbers.sort; #2
say @numbers;      #3

@numbers.=sort;
say @numbers;      #4

Output
[7 2 4 9 11 3 99] #1
(2 3 4 7 9 11 99) #2
[7 2 4 9 11 3 99] #3
[2 3 4 7 9 11 99] #4
Explanation

.push is a mutator; it changes the state of the array (#1)

.sort is a function; it returns a sorted array but doesn’t modify the state of the initial array:

(#2) shows that it returned a sorted array.

(#3) shows that the initial array is still unmodified.

In order to enforce a function to act as a mutator, we use .= instead of . (#4) (Line 9 of the script)

5. Loops and conditions

Raku has many conditional and looping constructs.

5.1. if

The code runs only if a condition has been met; i.e., an expression evaluates to True.

my $age = 19;

if $age > 18 {
  say 'Welcome'
}

In Raku, we can invert the code and the condition.
Even if the code and the condition have been inverted, the condition is always evaluated first.

my $age = 19;

say 'Welcome' if $age > 18;

If the condition is not met, we can specify alternate blocks for execution by using:

else

elsif

# run the same code for different values of the variable
my $number-of-seats = 9;

if $number-of-seats <= 5 {
  say 'I am a sedan'
} elsif $number-of-seats <= 7 {
  say 'I am 7 seater'
} else {
  say 'I am a van'
}
5.2. unless

The negated version of an if statement can be written using unless.

The following code:

my $clean-shoes = False;

if not $clean-shoes {
  say 'Clean your shoes'
}

can be written as:

my $clean-shoes = False;

unless $clean-shoes {
  say 'Clean your shoes'
}

Negation in Raku is done using either ! or not.

unless (condition) is used instead of if not (condition).

unless cannot have an else clause.

5.3. with

with behaves like the if statement, but checks if the variable is defined.

my Int $var=1;

with $var {
  say 'Hello'
}

If you run the code without assigning a value to the variable, nothing should happen.

my Int $var;

with $var {
  say 'Hello'
}

without is the negated version of with. You should be able to relate it to unless.

If the first with condition is not met, an alternate path can be specified using orwith.
with and orwith can be compared to if and elsif.

5.4. for

The for loop iterates over multiple values.

my @array = 1,2,3;

for @array -> $array-item {
  say $array-item * 100
}

Notice that we created an iteration variable $array-item and then performed the operation *100 on each array item.

5.5. given

given is the Raku equivalent of the switch statement in other languages, but much more powerful.

my $var = 42;

given $var {
    when 0..50 { say 'Less than or equal to 50'}
    when Int { say "is an Int" }
    when 42  { say 42 }
    default  { say "huh?" }
}

After a successful match, the matching process will stop.

Alternatively proceed will instruct Raku to continue matching even after a successful match.

my $var = 42;

given $var {
    when 0..50 { say 'Less than or equal to 50';proceed}
    when Int { say "is an Int";proceed}
    when 42  { say 42 }
    default  { say "huh?" }
}
5.6. loop

loop is another way of writing a for loop.

Actually, loop is how for loops are written in C-family programming languages.

Raku belongs to the C-family languages.

loop (my $i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) {
  say "The current number is $i"
}
	For more info on loops and conditions, see https://docs.raku.org/language/control
6. I/O

In Raku, two of the most common Input/Output interfaces are the Terminal and Files.

6.1. Basic I/O using the Terminal
6.1.1. say

say writes to the standard output. It appends a newline at the end. In other words, the following code:

say 'Hello Mam.';
say 'Hello Sir.';

will be written on 2 separate lines.

6.1.2. print

print on the other hand behaves like say but doesn’t add a new line.

Try replacing say with print and compare the results.

6.1.3. get

get is used to capture input from the terminal.

my $name;

say "Hi, what's your name?";
$name = get;

say "Dear $name welcome to Raku";

When the above code runs, the terminal will be waiting for you to input your name. Enter it and then hit [Enter]. Subsequently, it will greet you.

6.1.4. prompt

prompt is a combination of print and get.

The above example can be written like this:

my $name = prompt "Hi, what's your name? ";

say "Dear $name welcome to Raku";
6.2. Running Shell Commands

Two subroutines can be used to run shell commands:

run Runs an external command without involving a shell

shell Runs a command through the system shell. It is platform and shell dependent. All shell meta characters are interpreted by the shell, including pipes, redirects, environment variable substitutions and so on.

Run this if you’re on Linux/macOS
my $name = 'Neo';
run 'echo', "hello $name";
shell "ls";
Run this if you’re on Windows
shell "dir";

echo and ls are common shell keywords on Linux:
echo prints text to the terminal (the equivalent of say in Raku)
ls lists all files and folders in the current directory

dir is the equivalent of ls on Windows.

6.3. File I/O
6.3.1. slurp

slurp is used to read data from a file.

Create a text file with the following content:

datafile.txt
John 9
Johnnie 7
Jane 8
Joanna 7
my $data = slurp "datafile.txt";
say $data;
6.3.2. spurt

spurt is used to write data to a file.

my $newdata = "New scores:
Paul 10
Paulie 9
Paulo 11";

spurt "newdatafile.txt", $newdata;

After running the above code, a new file named newdatafile.txt will be created. It will contain the new scores.

6.4. Working with files and directories

Raku can list the contents of a directory without resorting to shell commands (by using ls, for example).

say dir;                # List files and folders in the current directory
say dir "/Documents";   # List files and folders in the specified directory

In addition, you can create and delete directories.

mkdir "newfolder";
rmdir "newfolder";

mkdir creates a new directory.
rmdir deletes an empty directory and returns an error if not empty.

You can also check if a path exists; if it is a file; or a directory:

In the directory where you will be running the below script, create an empty folder folder123 and an empty raku file script123.raku

say "script123.raku".IO.e;
say "folder123".IO.e;

say "script123.raku".IO.d;
say "folder123".IO.d;

say "script123.raku".IO.f;
say "folder123".IO.f;

IO.e checks if the directory/file exists.
IO.f checks if the path is a file.
IO.d checks if the path is a directory.

	Windows users can use / or \\ to define directories
C:\\rakudo\\bin
C:/rakudo/bin

	For more info on I/O, see https://docs.raku.org/type/IO
7. Subroutines
7.1. Definition

Subroutines (also called subs or functions) are a means of packaging and reusing functionality.


A subroutine definition begins with the keyword sub. After their definition, they can be called by their handle.
Check out the below example:

sub alien-greeting {
  say "Hello earthlings";
}

alien-greeting;

The previous example showcased a subroutine that doesn’t require any input.

7.2. Signature

Subroutines can require input. That input is provided by arguments. A subroutine may define zero or more parameters. The number and type of parameters that a subroutine defines is called its signature.

The below subroutine accepts a string argument.

sub say-hello (Str $name) {
    say "Hello " ~ $name ~ "!!!!"
}
say-hello "Paul";
say-hello "Paula";
7.3. Multiple dispatch

It is possible to define multiple subroutines that have the same name but different signatures. When the subroutine is called, the runtime environment will decide which version to use based on the number and type of supplied arguments. This type of subroutine is defined the same way as normal subs except that we use the multi keyword instead of sub.

multi greet($name) {
    say "Good morning $name";
}
multi greet($name, $title) {
    say "Good morning $title $name";
}

greet "Johnnie";
greet "Laura","Mrs.";
7.4. Default and Optional Parameters

If a subroutine is defined to accept an argument, and we call it without providing it with the required argument, it will fail.

Raku provides us the ability to define subroutines with:

Optional Parameters

Default Parameters

Optional parameters are defined by appending ? to the parameter name.

sub say-hello($name?) {
  with $name { say "Hello " ~ $name }
  else { say "Hello Human" }
}
say-hello;
say-hello("Laura");

If the user doesn’t need to supply an argument, a default value can be defined.
This is done by assigning a value to the parameter within the subroutine definition.

sub say-hello($name="Matt") {
  say "Hello " ~ $name;
}
say-hello;
say-hello("Laura");
7.5. Returning values

All the subroutines we’ve seen so far do something — they display some text on the terminal.

Sometimes, though, we execute a subroutine for its return value so we can use it later in the flow of our program.

If a function is allowed to run through it’s block to the end, the last statement or expression will determine the return value.

Implicit return
sub squared ($x) {
  $x ** 2;
}
say "7 squared is equal to " ~ squared(7);

For the sake of clarity, it might be a good idea to explicitly specify what we want returned. This can be done using the return keyword.

Explicit return
sub squared ($x) {
  return $x ** 2;
}
say "7 squared is equal to " ~ squared(7);
7.5.1. Restricting return values

In one of the previous examples, we saw how we can restrict the accepted argument to be of a certain type. The same can be done with return values.

To restrict the return value to a certain type, we use the arrow notation --> in the signature.

Indicating return type
sub squared ($x --> Int) {
  return $x ** 2;
}
say "1.2 squared is equal to " ~ squared(1.2);

If we fail to provide a return value that matches the type constraint, an error will be thrown.

Type check failed for return value; expected Int but got Rat (1.44)
	

Not only can type constraints control the type of the return value; they can also control its definedness.

In the previous examples, we specified that the return value should be an Int.

We could also have specified that the returned Int should be strictly defined or undefined using the following signatures:
-→ Int:D and -→ Int:U

That being said, it is good practice to use those type constraints.
Below is the modified version of the previous example that uses :D to force the returned Int to be defined.

sub squared ($x --> Int:D) {
  return $x ** 2;
}
say "1.2 squared is equal to " ~ squared(1.2);
	For more info on subroutines and functions, see https://docs.raku.org/language/functions
8. Functional Programming

In this chapter we will take a look at some of the features that facilitate Functional Programming.

8.1. Functions are first-class citizens

Functions/subroutines are first-class citizens:

They can be passed as arguments

They can be returned from other functions

They can be assigned to variables

A great example is the map function.
map is a higher order function, it can accept another function as an argument.

Script
my @array = <1 2 3 4 5>;
sub squared($x) {
  $x ** 2
}
say map(&squared,@array);
Output
(1 4 9 16 25)
Explanation

We defined a subroutine called squared that takes an argument and multiplies that argument by itself.
Next, we used map, a higher order function, and gave it two arguments, the squared subroutine and an array.
The result is a list of the squared elements of the array.

Notice that when passing a subroutine as an argument, we need to prepend & to its name.

8.2. Anonymous functions

An anonymous function is also called a lambda.
An anonymous function is not bound to an identifier (it has no name).

Let’s rewrite the map example and have it use an anonymous function

my @array = <1 2 3 4 5>;
say map(-> $x {$x ** 2},@array);

Notice that instead of declaring the squared subroutine and passing it as an argument to map, we defined it within the anonymous subroutine as -> $x {$x ** 2}.

In Raku parlance, we call this notation a pointy block

A pointy block may also be used to assign functions to variables:
my $squared = -> $x {
  $x ** 2
}
say $squared(9);
8.3. Chaining

In Raku, methods can be chained, so you’re not required to pass the result of one method to another as an argument.

To illustrate: Given an array, you may need to return the unique values of the array, sorted from biggest to smallest.

Here’s a non-chained solution:

my @array = <7 8 9 0 1 2 4 3 5 6 7 8 9>;
my @final-array = reverse(sort(unique(@array)));
say @final-array;

Here, we call unique on @array, pass the result as an argument to sort, and then pass that result to reverse.

In contrast, with chained methods, the above example can be rewritten as:

my @array = <7 8 9 0 1 2 4 3 5 6 7 8 9>;
my @final-array = @array.unique.sort.reverse;
say @final-array;

You can already see that chaining methods is easier on the eye.

8.4. Feed Operator

The feed operator, called pipe in some functional programming languages, further illustrates method chaining.

Forward Feed
my @array = <7 8 9 0 1 2 4 3 5 6 7 8 9>;
@array ==> unique()
       ==> sort()
       ==> reverse()
       ==> my @final-array;
say @final-array;
Explanation
Start with `@array` then return a list of unique elements
                    then sort it
                    then reverse it
                    then store the result in @final-array

Note that the flow of the method calls is top-down — from first to final step.

Backward Feed
my @array = <7 8 9 0 1 2 4 3 5 6 7 8 9>;
my @final-array-v2 <== reverse()
                   <== sort()
                   <== unique()
                   <== @array;
say @final-array-v2;
Explanation

The backward feed is like the forward feed, but in reverse.
The flow of the method calls is bottom-up — from final to first step.

8.5. Hyper operator

The hyper operator >>. will call a method on all elements of a list and return a list of the results.

my @array = <0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10>;
sub is-even($var) { $var %% 2 };

say @array>>.is-prime;
say @array>>.&is-even;

Using the hyper operator we can call methods already defined in Raku, e.g. is-prime that tells us if a number is prime or not.
In addition we can define new subroutines and call them using the hyper operator. In this case we have to prepend & to the name of the method; e.g., &is-even.

This is very practical as it relieves us from writing a for loop to iterate over each value.

	Raku guarantees that the order of the results is the same as that of the original list. However, there is no guarantee that Raku will actually call the methods in list order or in the same thread. So, be careful with methods that have side-effects, such as say or print.
8.6. Junctions

A junction is a logical superposition of values.

In the below example 1|2|3 is a junction.

my $var = 2;
if $var == 1|2|3 {
  say "The variable is 1 or 2 or 3"
}

The use of junctions usually triggers autothreading; the operation is carried out for each junction element, and all the results are combined into a new junction and returned.

8.7. Lazy Lists

A lazy list is a list that is lazily evaluated.
Lazy evaluation delays the evaluation of an expression until required, and avoids repeating evaluations by storing results in a lookup table.

The benefits include:

Performance increase by avoiding needless calculations

The ability to construct potentially infinite data structures

The ability to define control flow

To build a lazy list we use the infix operator …​
A lazy list has initial element(s), a generator and an endpoint.

Simple lazy list
my $lazylist = (1 ... 10);
say $lazylist;

The initial element is 1 and the endpoint is 10. No generator was defined so the default generator is the successor (+1)
In other words this lazy list may return (if requested) the following elements (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

Infinite lazy list
my $lazylist = (1 ... Inf);
say $lazylist;

This list may return (if requested) any integer between 1 and infinity, in other words any integer number.

Lazy list built using a deduced generator
my $lazylist = (0,2 ... 10);
say $lazylist;

The initial elements are 0 and 2 and the endpoint is 10. No generator was defined, but using the initial elements, Raku will deduce that the generator is (+2)
This lazy list may return (if requested) the following elements (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10)

Lazy list built using a defined generator
my $lazylist = (0, { $_ + 3 } ... 12);
say $lazylist;

In this example, we defined explicitly a generator enclosed in { }
This lazy list may return (if requested) the following elements (0, 3, 6, 9, 12)

	

When using an explicit generator, the endpoint must be one of the values that the generator can return.
If we reproduce the above example with the endpoint being 10 instead of 12, it will not stop. The generator jumps over the endpoint.

Alternatively you can replace 0 …​ 10 with 0 …​^ * > 10
You can read it as: From 0 until the first value greater than 10 (excluding it)

This will not stop the generator
my $lazylist = (0, { $_ + 3 } ... 10);
say $lazylist;
This will stop the generator
my $lazylist = (0, { $_ + 3 } ...^ * > 10);
say $lazylist;
8.8. Closures

All code objects in Raku are closures, which means they can reference lexical variables from an outer scope.

sub generate-greeting {
    my $name = "John Doe";
    sub greeting {
      say "Good Morning $name";
    };
    return &greeting;
}
my $generated = generate-greeting;
$generated();

If you run the above code, it will display Good Morning John Doe on the terminal.
While the result is fairly simple, what is interesting about this example, is that the greeting inner subroutine was returned from the outer subroutine before being executed.

$generated has become a closure.

A closure is a special kind of object that combines two things:

A Subroutine

The Environment in which that subroutine was created.

The environment consists of any local variable that was in-scope at the time that the closure was created. In this case, $generated is a closure that incorporates both the greeting subroutine and the John Doe string that existed when the closure was created.

Let’s take a look at a more interesting example.

sub greeting-generator($period) {
  return sub ($name) {
    return "Good $period $name"
  }
}
my $morning = greeting-generator("Morning");
my $evening = greeting-generator("Evening");

say $morning("John");
say $evening("Jane");

In this example, we have defined a subroutine greeting-generator($period) that accepts a single argument $period and returns a new subroutine. The subroutine it returns accepts a single argument $name and returns the constructed greeting.

Basically, greeting-generator is a subroutine factory. In this example, we used greeting-generator to create two new subroutines, one that says Good Morning and one that says Good Evening.

$morning and $evening are both closures. They share the same subroutine body definition, but store different environments.
In $morning 's environment $period is Morning. In $evening 's environment $period is Evening.

9. Classes & Objects

In the previous chapter, we learned how Raku facilitates Functional Programming.
In this chapter we will take a look at Object Oriented programming in Raku.

9.1. Introduction

Object Oriented programming is one of the widely used paradigms nowadays.
An object is a set of variables and subroutines bundled together.
The variables are called attributes and the subroutines are called methods.
Attributes define the state and methods define the behavior of an object.

A class is a template for creating objects.


In order to understand the relationship consider the below example:

There are 4 people present in a room

	

objects ⇒ 4 people




These 4 people are humans

	

class ⇒ Human




They have different names, age, sex and nationality

	

attributes ⇒ name, age, sex, nationality

In object oriented parlance, we say that objects are instances of a class.

Consider the below script:

class Human {
  has $.name;
  has $.age;
  has $.sex;
  has $.nationality;
}

my $john = Human.new(name => 'John', age => 23, sex => 'M', nationality => 'American');
say $john;

The class keyword is used to define a class.
The has keyword is used to define attributes of a class.
The .new() method is called a constructor. It creates the object as an instance of the class it has been called on.

In the above script, a new variable $john holds a reference to a new instance of "Human" defined by Human.new().
The arguments passed to the .new() method are used to set the attributes of the underlying object.

A class can be given lexical scope using my:

my class Human {

}
9.2. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is an object oriented concept that bundles a set of data and methods together.
The data (attributes) within an object should be private, in other words, accessible only from within the object.
In order to access the attributes from outside the object, we use methods called accessors.

The below two scripts have the same result.

Direct access to the variable:
my $var = 7;
say $var;
Encapsulation:
my $var = 7;
sub sayvar {
  $var;
}
say sayvar;

The method sayvar is an accessor. It lets us access the value of the variable without getting direct access to it.

Encapsulation is facilitated in Raku with the use of twigils.
Twigils are secondary sigils. They come between the sigil and the attribute name.
Two twigils are used in classes:

! is used to explicitly declare that the attribute is private.

. is used to automatically generate an accessor for the attribute.

By default, all attributes are private but it is a good habit to always use the ! twigil.

Therefore, we should rewrite the above class as:

class Human {
  has $!name;
  has $!age;
  has $!sex;
  has $!nationality;
}

my $john = Human.new(name => 'John', age => 23, sex => 'M', nationality => 'American');
say $john;

Append to the script the following statement: say $john.age;
It will return this error: Method 'age' not found for invocant of class 'Human' because $!age is private and can only be used within the object. Trying to access it outside the object will return an error.

Now replace has $!age with has $.age and observe the result of say $john.age;

9.3. Named vs. Positional Parameters

In Raku, all classes inherit a default .new() constructor.
It can be used to create objects by providing it with arguments.
The default constructor can only be provided with named arguments.
In our example above, notice that the arguments supplied to .new() are defined by name:

name => 'John'

age => 23

What if I do not want to supply the name of each attribute each time I want to create an object?
Then I need to create another constructor that accepts positional arguments.

class Human {
  has $.name;
  has $.age;
  has $.sex;
  has $.nationality;
  # new constructor that overrides the default one.
  method new ($name,$age,$sex,$nationality) {
    self.bless(:$name,:$age,:$sex,:$nationality);
  }
}

my $john = Human.new('John',23,'M','American');
say $john;
9.4. Methods
9.4.1. Introduction

Methods are the subroutines of an object.
Like subroutines, they are a means of packaging a set of functionality, they accept arguments, have a signature and can be defined as multi.

Methods are defined using the method keyword.
In normal circumstances, methods are required to perform some sort of action on the objects' attributes. This enforces the concept of encapsulation. Object attributes can only be manipulated from within the object using methods. The outside world can only interact with the object methods, and has no direct access to its attributes.

class Human {
  has $.name;
  has $.age;
  has $.sex;
  has $.nationality;
  has $.eligible;
  method assess-eligibility {
      if self.age < 21 {
        $!eligible = 'No'
      } else {
        $!eligible = 'Yes'
      }
  }

}

my $john = Human.new(name => 'John', age => 23, sex => 'M', nationality => 'American');
$john.assess-eligibility;
say $john.eligible;

Once methods are defined within a class, they can be called on an object using the dot notation:
object . method or as in the above example: $john.assess-eligibility

Within the definition of a method, if we need to reference the object itself to call another method we use the self keyword.


Within the definition of a method, if we need to reference an attribute we use ! even if it was defined with .
The rationale being that what the . twigil does is declare an attribute with ! and automate the creation of an accessor.

In the above example, if self.age < 21 and if $!age < 21 would have the same effect, although they are technically different:

self.age calls the .age method (accessor)
Can be written alternatively as $.age

$!age is a direct call to the variable

9.4.2. Private methods

Normal methods can be called on objects from outside the class.

Private methods are methods that can only be called from within the class.
A possible use case would be a method that calls another one for specific action. The method that interfaces with the outside world is public while the one referenced should stay private. We do not want users to call it directly, so we declare it as private.

The declaration of a private method requires the use of the ! twigil before its name.
Private methods are called with ! instead of .

method !iamprivate {
  # code goes in here
}

method iampublic {
  self!iamprivate;
  # do additional things
}
9.5. Class Attributes

Class attributes are attributes that belong to the class itself and not to its objects.
They can be initialized during definition.
Class attributes are declared using my instead of has.
They are called on the class itself instead of its objects.

class Human {
  has $.name;
  my $.counter = 0;
  method new($name) {
    Human.counter++;
    self.bless(:$name);
  }
}
my $a = Human.new('a');
my $b = Human.new('b');

say Human.counter;
9.6. Access Type

Until now, all the examples that we’ve seen have used accessors to get information from the objects' attributes.

What if we need to modify the value of an attribute?
We need to label it as read/write using the keywords is rw

class Human {
  has $.name;
  has $.age is rw;
}
my $john = Human.new(name => 'John', age => 21);
say $john.age;

$john.age = 23;
say $john.age;

By default, all attributes are declared as read only but you can explicitly do it using is readonly

9.7. Inheritance
9.7.1. Introduction

Inheritance is another concept of object oriented programming.

When defining classes, soon enough we will realize that some attributes/methods are common to many classes.
Should we duplicate code?
NO! We should use inheritance

Let’s consider we want to define two classes, a class for Human beings and a class for Employees.
Human beings have 2 attributes: name and age.
Employees have 4 attributes: name, age, company and salary

One would be tempted to define the classes as:

class Human {
  has $.name;
  has $.age;
}

class Employee {
  has $.name;
  has $.age;
  has $.company;
  has $.salary;
}

While technically correct, the above piece of code is considered conceptually poor.

A better way to write this would be:

class Human {
  has $.name;
  has $.age;
}

class Employee is Human {
  has $.company;
  has $.salary;
}

The is keyword defines inheritance.
In object oriented parlance, we say Employee is a child of Human and that Human is a parent of Employee.

All child classes inherit the attributes and methods of the parent class, so there is no need to redefine them.

9.7.2. Overriding

Classes inherit all attributes and methods from their parent classes.
There are cases where we need the method in the child class to behave differently than the one inherited.
To achieve this, we redefine the method in the child class.
This concept is called overriding.

In the below example, the method introduce-yourself is inherited by the Employee class.

class Human {
  has $.name;
  has $.age;
  method introduce-yourself {
    say 'Hi I am a human being, my name is ' ~ self.name;
  }
}

class Employee is Human {
  has $.company;
  has $.salary;
}

my $john = Human.new(name =>'John', age => 23,);
my $jane = Employee.new(name =>'Jane', age => 25, company => 'Acme', salary => 4000);

$john.introduce-yourself;
$jane.introduce-yourself;

Overriding works like this:

class Human {
  has $.name;
  has $.age;
  method introduce-yourself {
    say 'Hi I am a human being, my name is ' ~ self.name;
  }
}

class Employee is Human {
  has $.company;
  has $.salary;
  method introduce-yourself {
    say 'Hi I am a employee, my name is ' ~ self.name ~ ' and I work at: ' ~ self.company;
  }

}

my $john = Human.new(name =>'John',age => 23,);
my $jane = Employee.new(name =>'Jane',age => 25,company => 'Acme',salary => 4000);

$john.introduce-yourself;
$jane.introduce-yourself;

Depending of which class the object is, the right method will be called.

9.7.3. Submethods

Submethods are a type of method that are not inherited by child classes.
They are only accessible from the class they were declared in.
They are defined using the submethod keyword.

9.8. Multiple Inheritance

Multiple inheritance is allowed in Raku. A class can inherit from multiple other classes.

class bar-chart {
  has Int @.bar-values;
  method plot {
    say @.bar-values;
  }
}

class line-chart {
  has Int @.line-values;
  method plot {
    say @.line-values;
  }
}

class combo-chart is bar-chart is line-chart {
}

my $actual-sales = bar-chart.new(bar-values => [10,9,11,8,7,10]);
my $forecast-sales = line-chart.new(line-values => [9,8,10,7,6,9]);

my $actual-vs-forecast = combo-chart.new(bar-values => [10,9,11,8,7,10],
                                         line-values => [9,8,10,7,6,9]);
say "Actual sales:";
$actual-sales.plot;
say "Forecast sales:";
$forecast-sales.plot;
say "Actual vs Forecast:";
$actual-vs-forecast.plot;
Output
Actual sales:
[10 9 11 8 7 10]
Forecast sales:
[9 8 10 7 6 9]
Actual vs Forecast:
[10 9 11 8 7 10]
Explanation

The combo-chart class should be able to hold two series, one for the actual values plotted on bars, and another for forecast values plotted on a line.
This is why we defined it as a child of line-chart and bar-chart.
You should have noticed that calling the method plot on the combo-chart didn’t yield the required result. Only one series was plotted.
Why did this happen?
combo-chart inherits from line-chart and bar-chart, and both of them have a method called plot. When we call that method on combo-chart Raku internals will try to resolve the conflict by calling one of the inherited methods.

Correction

In order to behave correctly, we should have overridden the method plot in the combo-chart.

class bar-chart {
  has Int @.bar-values;
  method plot {
    say @.bar-values;
  }
}

class line-chart {
  has Int @.line-values;
  method plot {
    say @.line-values;
  }
}

class combo-chart is bar-chart is line-chart {
  method plot {
    say @.bar-values;
    say @.line-values;
  }
}

my $actual-sales = bar-chart.new(bar-values => [10,9,11,8,7,10]);
my $forecast-sales = line-chart.new(line-values => [9,8,10,7,6,9]);

my $actual-vs-forecast = combo-chart.new(bar-values => [10,9,11,8,7,10],
                                         line-values => [9,8,10,7,6,9]);
say "Actual sales:";
$actual-sales.plot;
say "Forecast sales:";
$forecast-sales.plot;
say "Actual vs Forecast:";
$actual-vs-forecast.plot;
Output
Actual sales:
[10 9 11 8 7 10]
Forecast sales:
[9 8 10 7 6 9]
Actual vs Forecast:
[10 9 11 8 7 10]
[9 8 10 7 6 9]
9.9. Roles

Roles are similar to classes in that they are a collection of attributes and methods.

Roles are declared with the keyword role. Classes that wish to implement a role, do so using the does keyword.

Let’s rewrite the multiple inheritance example using roles:
role bar-chart {
  has Int @.bar-values;
  method plot {
    say @.bar-values;
  }
}

role line-chart {
  has Int @.line-values;
  method plot {
    say @.line-values;
  }
}

class combo-chart does bar-chart does line-chart {
  method plot {
    say @.bar-values;
    say @.line-values;
  }
}

my $actual-sales = bar-chart.new(bar-values => [10,9,11,8,7,10]);
my $forecast-sales = line-chart.new(line-values => [9,8,10,7,6,9]);

my $actual-vs-forecast = combo-chart.new(bar-values => [10,9,11,8,7,10],
                                         line-values => [9,8,10,7,6,9]);
say "Actual sales:";
$actual-sales.plot;
say "Forecast sales:";
$forecast-sales.plot;
say "Actual vs Forecast:";
$actual-vs-forecast.plot;

Run the above script and you will see that results are the same.

By now you’re asking yourself: If roles behave like classes, what’s their use?
To answer your question, modify the first script used to showcase multiple inheritance, the one where we forgot to override the plot method.

role bar-chart {
  has Int @.bar-values;
  method plot {
    say @.bar-values;
  }
}

role line-chart {
  has Int @.line-values;
  method plot {
    say @.line-values;
  }
}

class combo-chart does bar-chart does line-chart {
}

my $actual-sales = bar-chart.new(bar-values => [10,9,11,8,7,10]);
my $forecast-sales = line-chart.new(line-values => [9,8,10,7,6,9]);

my $actual-vs-forecast = combo-chart.new(bar-values => [10,9,11,8,7,10],
                                         line-values => [9,8,10,7,6,9]);
say "Actual sales:";
$actual-sales.plot;
say "Forecast sales:";
$forecast-sales.plot;
say "Actual vs Forecast:";
$actual-vs-forecast.plot;
Output
===SORRY!===
Method 'plot' must be resolved by class combo-chart because it exists in multiple roles (line-chart, bar-chart)
Explanation

If multiple roles are applied to the same class and a conflict exists, a compile-time error will be thrown.
This is a much safer approach than multiple inheritance, where conflicts are not considered errors and are simply resolved at runtime.

Roles will warn you that there’s a conflict.

9.10. Introspection

Introspection is the process of getting information about an object, like its type, attributes or methods.

class Human {
  has Str $.name;
  has Int $.age;
  method introduce-yourself {
    say 'Hi I am a human being, my name is ' ~ self.name;
  }
}

class Employee is Human {
  has Str $.company;
  has Int $.salary;
  method introduce-yourself {
    say 'Hi I am a employee, my name is ' ~ self.name ~ ' and I work at: ' ~ self.company;
  }
}

my $john = Human.new(name =>'John',age => 23,);
my $jane = Employee.new(name =>'Jane',age => 25,company => 'Acme',salary => 4000);

say $john.WHAT;
say $jane.WHAT;
say $john.^attributes;
say $jane.^attributes;
say $john.^methods;
say $jane.^methods;
say $jane.^parents;
if $jane ~~ Human {say 'Jane is a Human'};

Introspection is facilitated by:

.WHAT — returns the class from which the object was created

.^attributes — returns all the attributes of the object

.^methods — returns all the methods that can be called on the object

.^parents — returns the parent classes of the object

~~ is called the smart-match operator. It evaluates to True if the object is created from the class it is being compared against or any of its inheritances.

10. Exception Handling
10.1. Catching Exceptions

Exceptions are a special behavior that happens at runtime when something goes wrong.
We say that exceptions are thrown.

Consider the below script that runs correctly:

my Str $name;
$name = "Joanna";
say "Hello " ~ $name;
say "How are you doing today?"
Output
Hello Joanna
How are you doing today?

Now consider this script that throws an exception:

my Str $name;
$name = 123;
say "Hello " ~ $name;
say "How are you doing today?"
Output
Type check failed in assignment to $name; expected Str but got Int
   in block <unit> at exceptions.raku:2

Notice that whenever an error occurs (in this case, assigning a number to a string variable) the program will stop and other lines of code will not be evaluated.

Exception handling is the process of catching an exception that has been thrown in order for the script to continue working.

my Str $name;
try {
  $name = 123;
  say "Hello " ~ $name;
  CATCH {
    default {
      say "Can you tell us your name again, we couldn't find it in the register.";
    }
  }
}
say "How are you doing today?";
Output
Can you tell us your name again, we couldn't find it in the register.
How are you doing today?

Exception handling is done by using a try-catch block.

try {
  # code goes in here
  # if anything goes wrong, the script will enter the below CATCH block
  # if nothing goes wrong, the CATCH block will be ignored
  CATCH {
    default {
      # the code in here will be evaluated only if an exception has been thrown
    }
  }
}

The CATCH block can be defined the same way a given block is defined. This means we can catch and handle differently many types of exceptions.

try {
  # code goes in here
  # if anything goes wrong, the script will enter the below CATCH block
  # if nothing goes wrong, the CATCH block will be ignored
  CATCH {
    when X::AdHoc   { # do something if exception of type X::AdHoc is thrown }
    when X::IO      { # do something if exception of type X::IO is thrown }
    when X::OS      { # do something if exception of type X::OS is thrown }
    default         { # do something if exception is thrown and doesn't belong to the above types }
  }
}
10.2. Throwing Exceptions

Raku also allows you to explicitly throw exceptions.
Two types of exceptions can be thrown:

ad-hoc exceptions

typed exceptions

ad-hoc
my Int $age = 21;
die "Error !";
typed
my Int $age = 21;
X::AdHoc.new(payload => 'Error !').throw;

Ad-hoc exceptions are thrown using the die subroutine, followed by the exception message.

Typed exceptions are objects, hence the use of the .new() constructor in the above example.
All typed exceptions descend from class X , below are a few examples:
X::AdHoc is the simplest exception type
X::IO is related to IO errors
X::OS is related to OS errors
X::Str::Numeric related to trying to coerce a string to a number

	For a complete list of exception types and their associated methods, go to https://docs.raku.org/type-exceptions.html
11. Regular Expressions

A regular expression, or regex, is a sequence of characters that is used for pattern matching.
Think of it as a pattern.

if 'enlightenment' ~~ m/ light / {
    say "enlightenment contains the word light";
}

In this example, the smart match operator ~~ is used to check if a string (enlightenment) contains the word (light).
"Enlightenment" is matched against the regex m/ light /

11.1. Regex definition

A regular expression can be defined like this:

/light/

m/light/

rx/light/

Unless specified explicitly, white space is ignored; m/light/ and m/ light / are the same.

11.2. Matching characters

Alphanumeric characters and the underscore _ are written as is.
All other characters have to be escaped using a backslash or surrounded by quotes.

Backslash
if 'Temperature: 13' ~~ m/ \: / {
    say "The string provided contains a colon :";
}
Single quotes
if 'Age = 13' ~~ m/ '=' / {
    say "The string provided contains an equal character = ";
}
Double quotes
if 'name@company.com' ~~ m/ "@" / {
    say "This is a valid email address because it contains an @ character";
}
11.3. Matching categories of characters

Characters can be classified into categories and we can match against them.
We can also match against the inverse of that category (everything except it):

Category

	

Regex

	

Inverse

	

Regex




Word character (letter, digit or underscore)

	

\w

	

Any character except a word character

	

\W




Digit

	

\d

	

Any character except a digit

	

\D




Whitespace

	

\s

	

Any character except a whitespace

	

\S




Horizontal whitespace

	

\h

	

Any character except a horizontal whitespace

	

\H




Vertical whitespace

	

\v

	

Any character except a vertical whitespace

	

\V




Tab

	

\t

	

Any character except a Tab

	

\T




New line

	

\n

	

Any character except a new line

	

\N

if "John123" ~~ / \d / {
  say "This is not a valid name, numbers are not allowed";
} else {
  say "This is a valid name"
}
if "John-Doe" ~~ / \s / {
  say "This string contains whitespace";
} else {
  say "This string doesn't contain whitespace"
}
11.4. Unicode properties

Matching against categories of characters, as seen in the preceding section, is convenient.
That being said, a more systematic approach would be to use Unicode properties.
This allows you to match against categories of characters inside and outside of
the ASCII standard.
Unicode properties are enclosed in <: >

if "Devanagari Numbers १२३" ~~ / <:N> / {
  say "Contains a number";
} else {
  say "Doesn't contain a number"
}
if "Привет, Иван." ~~ / <:Lu> / {
  say "Contains an uppercase letter";
} else {
  say "Doesn't contain an upper case letter"
}
if "John-Doe" ~~ / <:Pd> / {
  say "Contains a dash";
} else {
  say "Doesn't contain a dash"
}
11.5. Wildcards

Wildcards can also be used in a regex.

The dot . means any single character.

if 'abc' ~~ m/ a.c / {
    say "Match";
}
if 'a2c' ~~ m/ a.c / {
    say "Match";
}
if 'ac' ~~ m/ a.c / {
    say "Match";
} else {
    say "No Match";
}
11.6. Quantifiers

Quantifiers come after a character and are used to specify how many times we are expecting it.

The question mark ? means zero or one time.

if 'ac' ~~ m/ a?c / {
    say "Match";
} else {
    say "No Match";
}
if 'c' ~~ m/ a?c / {
    say "Match";
} else {
    say "No Match";
}

The star * means zero or multiple times.

if 'az' ~~ m/ a*z / {
    say "Match";
} else {
    say "No Match";
}
if 'aaz' ~~ m/ a*z / {
    say "Match";
} else {
    say "No Match";
}
if 'aaaaaaaaaaz' ~~ m/ a*z / {
    say "Match";
} else {
    say "No Match";
}
if 'z' ~~ m/ a*z / {
    say "Match";
} else {
    say "No Match";
}

The + means at least one time.

if 'az' ~~ m/ a+z / {
    say "Match";
} else {
    say "No Match";
}
if 'aaz' ~~ m/ a+z / {
    say "Match";
} else {
    say "No Match";
}
if 'aaaaaaaaaaz' ~~ m/ a+z / {
    say "Match";
} else {
    say "No Match";
}
if 'z' ~~ m/ a+z / {
    say "Match";
} else {
    say "No Match";
}
11.7. Match Results

Whenever the process of matching a string against a regex is successful, the match result is stored in a special variable $/

Script
if 'Rakudo is a Perl 6 compiler' ~~ m/:s Perl 6/ {
    say "The match is: " ~ $/;
    say "The string before the match is: " ~ $/.prematch;
    say "The string after the match is: " ~ $/.postmatch;
    say "The matching string starts at position: " ~ $/.from;
    say "The matching string ends at position: " ~ $/.to;
}
Output
The match is: Perl 6
The string before the match is: Rakudo is a
The string after the match is: compiler
The matching string starts at position: 12
The matching string ends at position: 18
Explanation

$/ returns a Match Object (the string that matches the regex)
The following methods can be called on the Match Object:
.prematch returns the string preceding the match.
.postmatch returns the string following the match.
.from returns the starting position of the match.
.to returns the ending position of the match.


	By default, whitespace in a regex definition is ignored.
If we want to match against a regex containing whitespace, we have to do so explicitly.
The :s in the regex m/:s Perl 6/ forces whitespace to be considered.
Alternatively, we could have written the regex as m/ Perl\s6 / and used \s which represents a whitespace.
If a regex contains more than a single whitespace, using :s is a better option than using \s for each and every whitespace.
11.8. Example

Let’s check if an email is valid or not.
For the sake of this example we will assume that a valid email address has this format:
first name [dot] last name [at] company [dot] (com/org/net)

	The regex used in this example for email validation is not very accurate.
Its sole purpose is to demonstrate regex functionality in Raku.
Do not use it as-is in production.
Script
my $email = 'john.doe@perl6.org';
my $regex = / <:L>+\.<:L>+\@<:L+:N>+\.<:L>+ /;

if $email ~~ $regex {
  say $/ ~ " is a valid email";
} else {
  say "This is not a valid email";
}
Output

john.doe@perl6.org is a valid email

Explanation

<:L> matches a single letter
<:L>+ matches one or more letters
\. matches a single [dot] character
\@ matches a single [at] character
<:L+:N> matches a letter or a single number
<:L+:N>+ matches one or more letters or numbers


The regex can be decomposed as following:

first name <:L>+

[dot] \.

last name <:L>+

[at] \@

company name <:L+:N>+

[dot] \.

com/org/net <:L>+

Alternatively, a regex can be broken down into multiple named regexes
my $email = 'john.doe@perl6.org';
my regex many-letters { <:L>+ };
my regex dot { \. };
my regex at { \@ };
my regex many-letters-numbers { <:L+:N>+ };

if $email ~~ / <many-letters> <dot> <many-letters> <at> <many-letters-numbers> <dot> <many-letters> / {
  say $/ ~ " is a valid email";
} else {
  say "This is not a valid email";
}

A named regex is defined using the following syntax: my regex regex-name { regex definition }
A named regex can be called using the following syntax: <regex-name>

	For more info on regexes, see https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes
12. Raku Modules

Raku is a general purpose programming language. It can be used to tackle a multitude of tasks including: text manipulation, graphics, web, databases, network protocols etc.

Reusability is a very important concept whereby programmers don’t have to reinvent the wheel each time they want to do a new task.

Raku allows the creation and redistribution of modules. Each module is a packaged set of functionality that can be reused once installed.

Zef is a module management tool that comes with Rakudo Star.

To install a specific module, type the below command in your terminal:

zef install "module name"

	The Raku modules directory can be found on: https://modules.raku.org/
12.1. Using Modules

MD5 is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit hash value.
MD5 has a variety of applications, including the encryption of stored passwords in a database. When a new user registers, their credentials are not stored as plain text but rather hashed. The rationale behind this is that if the DB gets compromised, the attacker will not be able to know what the passwords are.

Luckily, you don’t need to implement the MD5 algorithm yourself; there’s a Raku module already implemented.

Let’s install it:
zef install Digest::MD5

Now, run the below script:

use Digest::MD5;
my $password = "password123";
my $hashed-password = Digest::MD5.new.md5_hex($password);

say $hashed-password;

In order to run the md5_hex() function that creates hashes, we need to load the required module.
The use keyword loads the module for use in the script.

	In practice MD5 hashing alone is not sufficient, because it is prone to dictionary attacks.
It should be combined with a salt https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography).
13. Unicode

Unicode is a standard for encoding and representing text for most writing systems in the world.
UTF-8 is a character encoding capable of encoding all possible characters, or code points, in Unicode.

Characters are defined by a:
Grapheme: Visual representation.
Code point: A number assigned to the character.
Code point name: A name assigned to the character.

13.1. Using Unicode
Let’s look at how we can output characters using Unicode
say "a";
say "\x0061";
say "\c[LATIN SMALL LETTER A]";

The above 3 lines showcase different ways of building a character:

Writing the character directly (grapheme)

Using \x and the code point

Using \c and the code point name

Now lets output a smiley
say "☺";
say "\x263a";
say "\c[WHITE SMILING FACE]";
Another example combining two code points
say "á";
say "\x00e1";
say "\x0061\x0301";
say "\c[LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH ACUTE]";

The letter á can be written:

using its unique code point \x00e1

or as a combination of the code points of a and acute \x0061\x0301

Some of the methods that can be used:
say "á".NFC;
say "á".NFD;
say "á".uniname;
Output
NFC:0x<00e1>
NFD:0x<0061 0301>
LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH ACUTE

NFC returns the unique code point.
NFD decomposes the character and return the code point of each part.
uniname returns the code point name.

Unicode letters can be used as identifiers:
my $Δ = 1;
$Δ++;
say $Δ;
Unicode can be used to do math:
my $var = 2 + ⅒;
say $var;
13.2. Unicode-aware Operations
13.2.1. Numbers

Arabic numerals are the ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. This numeral set is the most used worldwide.

Nonetheless different sets of numerals are used to a lesser extent in different parts of the world.

No special care needs to be taken when using a numeral set different than the Arabic numerals. All methods/operators work as expected.

say (٤,٥,٦,1,2,3).sort; # (1 2 3 4 5 6)
say 1 + ٩;              # 10
13.2.2. Strings

If we were to use generic string operations, we might not always get the result that we were looking for, especially when comparing or sorting.

Comparison
say 'a' cmp 'B'; # More

The above example shows that a is bigger than B. The reason being that the code point of lowercase a is bigger than the code point of capital B.

While technically correct, this is probably not what we were looking for.

Luckily Raku has methods/operators that implement the Unicode Collation Algorithm.
One of them is unicmp that behaves like the above showcased cmp but is unicode-aware.

say 'a' unicmp 'B'; # Less

As you can see, using the unicmp operator now yields the expected result that a is smaller than B.

Sorting

As an alternative to the sort method that sorts using code points, Raku provides a collate method that implements the Unicode Collation Algorithm.

say ('a','b','c','D','E','F').sort;    # (D E F a b c)
say ('a','b','c','D','E','F').collate; # (a b c D E F)
14. Parallelism, Concurrency and Asynchrony
14.1. Parallelism

Under normal circumstances, all tasks in a program run sequentially.
This might not be a problem, unless what you’re trying to do takes a lot of time.

Thankfully, Raku has features that will enable you to run things in parallel.
At this stage, it is important to note that parallelism can mean one of two things:

Task Parallelism: Two (or more) independent expressions running in parallel.

Data Parallelism: A single expression iterating over a list of elements in parallel.

Let’s begin with the latter.

14.1.1. Data Parallelism
my @array = 0..50000;                       # Array population
my @result = @array.map({ is-prime $_ });   # call is-prime for each array element
say now - INIT now;                         # Output the time it took for the script to complete
Considering the above example:

We are only doing one operation @array.map({ is-prime $_ })
The is-prime subroutine is being called for each array element sequentially:
is-prime @array[0] then is-prime @array[1] then is-prime @array[2] etc.

Fortunately we can call is-prime on multiple array elements at the same time:
my @array = 0..50000;                           # Array population
my @result = @array.race.map({ is-prime $_ });  # call is-prime for each array element
say now - INIT now;                             # Output the time it took to complete

Notice the use of race in the expression. This method will enable parallel iteration of the array elements.

After running both examples (with and without race), compare the time it took for both scripts to complete.

	

race will not preserve the order of elements. If you wish to do, so use hyper instead.

race
my @array = 1..1000;
my @result = @array.race.map( {$_ + 1} );
.say for @result;
hyper
my @array = 1..1000;
my @result = @array.hyper.map( {$_ + 1} );
.say for @result;

If you run both examples, you should notice that one is sorted and the other is not.

14.1.2. Task Parallelism
my @array1 = 0..49999;
my @array2 = 2..50001;

my @result1 = @array1.map( {is-prime($_ + 1)} );
my @result2 = @array2.map( {is-prime($_ - 1)} );

say @result1 eqv @result2;

say now - INIT now;
Considering the above example:

We defined 2 arrays

applied a different operation for each array and stored the results

and checked if both results are the same

The script waits for @array1.map( {is-prime($_ + 1)} ) to finish
and then evaluates @array2.map( {is-prime($_ - 1)} )

Both operations applied to each array do not depend on each other.

Why not do both in parallel?
my @array1 = 0..49999;
my @array2 = 2..50001;

my $promise1 = start @array1.map( {is-prime($_ + 1)} ).eager;
my $promise2 = start @array2.map( {is-prime($_ - 1)} ).eager;

my @result1 = await $promise1;
my @result2 = await $promise2;

say @result1 eqv @result2;

say now - INIT now;
Explanation

The start subroutine evaluates the code and returns an object of type promise or shortly a promise.
If the code is evaluated correctly, the promise will be kept.
If the code throws an exception, the promise will be broken.

The await subroutine waits for a promise.
If it’s kept it will get the returned values.
If it’s broken it will get the exception thrown.

Check the time it took each script to complete.

	Parallelism always adds a threading overhead. If that overhead is not offset by gains in computational speed, the script will seem slower.
This is why, using race, hyper, start and await for fairly simple scripts can actually slow them down.
14.2. Concurrency and Asynchrony
	For more info on Concurrency and Asynchronous Programming, see https://docs.raku.org/language/concurrency
15. Native Calling Interface

Raku gives us the ability to use C libraries, using the Native Calling Interface.

NativeCall is a standard module that ships with Raku and offers a set of functionality to ease the job of interfacing Raku and C.

15.1. Calling a function

Consider the below C code that defines a function called hellofromc. This function prints on the terminal Hello from C. It doesn’t accept any argument nor return any value.

ncitest.c
#include <stdio.h>

void hellofromc () {
  printf("Hello from C\n");
}

Depending on your OS run the following commands to compile the above C code into a library.

On Linux:
gcc -c -fpic ncitest.c
gcc -shared -o libncitest.so ncitest.o
On Windows:
gcc -c ncitest.c
gcc -shared -o ncitest.dll ncitest.o
On macOS:
gcc -dynamiclib -o libncitest.dylib ncitest.c

Within the same directory where you compiled your C library, create a new Raku file that contains the below code and run it.

ncitest.raku
use NativeCall;

constant LIBPATH = "$*CWD/ncitest";
sub hellofromc() is native(LIBPATH) { * }

hellofromc();
Explanation:

First of all we declared that we will be using the NativeCall module.
Then we created a constant LIBPATH that holds the path to the C library.
Notice that $*CWD returns the current working directory.
Then we created a new Raku subroutine called hellofromc() that should act as a wrapper to its counterpart C function having the same name and residing in the C library found in LIBPATH.
All of this was done by using the is native trait.
Finally we called our Raku subroutine.

In essence, it all boils down to declaring a subroutine with the trait is native and the name of the C library.

15.2. Renaming a function

In the above part, we saw how we can call a very simple C function by wrapping it with a Raku subroutine having the same name, using the is native trait.

In some cases, we would want to change the name of the Raku subroutine.
To do so, we use the is symbol trait.

Lets modify the above Raku script and rename the Raku subroutine hello instead of hellofromc

ncitest.raku
use NativeCall;

constant LIBPATH = "$*CWD/ncitest";
sub hello() is native(LIBPATH) is symbol('hellofromc') { * }

hello();
Explanation:

In case the Raku subroutine has a different name than its C counterpart, we should use the is symbol trait with the name of the original C function.

15.3. Passing Arguments

Compile the following modified C library and run the Raku script found below again.
Notice how we modified both C and Raku code to accept a string (char* in C and Str in Raku)

ncitest.c
#include <stdio.h>

void hellofromc (char* name) {
  printf("Hello, %s! This is C!\n", name);
}
ncitest.raku
use NativeCall;

constant LIBPATH = "$*CWD/ncitest";
sub hello(Str) is native(LIBPATH) is symbol('hellofromc') { * }

hello('Jane');
15.4. Returning values

Lets repeat the process one more time and create a simple calculator that takes 2 integers and add them.
Compile the C library and run the Raku script.

ncitest.c
int add (int a, int b) {
  return (a + b);
}
ncitest.raku
use NativeCall;

constant LIBPATH = "$*CWD/ncitest";
sub add(int32,int32 --> int32) is native(LIBPATH) { * }

say add(2,3);

Notice how both C and Raku functions accept two integers and return one (int in C and int32 in Raku)

15.5. Types

You might have asked yourself why did we use int32 instead of Int in the latest Raku script.
Some Raku types like Int, Rat etc. can’t be used as is to pass and receive values from a C function.
One must use in Raku the same types as the ones in C.

Luckily Raku provides many types that map to their respective C counterpart.

int8




int8_t

int16

Taiwanese Service Provider Far EasTone Builds the First Dual-Mode 5G Core Lab with Ericsson

SHARE
The MoU agreement signed between Far EasTone and Ericsson in June focuses on the network for the future to drive Taiwanese digitalization.
The initiative includes constructing a new joint AI lab and expanding existing 5G Lab capabilities to evaluate network evolution strategies and continue building a future network.
FET will join the Ericsson Startup 5G program to evaluate potential partners and use cases for 5G monetization.

Far EasTone (FET) Telecom announced to have established the first dual-mode 5G core lab in Taiwan with Ericsson following signing an MoU in expanding 5G partnership together last month.

FET has reportedly set up a 5G Standalone testing platform that has gone into operation. As part of the agreement, Ericsson supports the expansion of FET’s 5G Lab to conduct new advanced technology trials and demonstrations, such as 5G network slicing, edge computing, private networks, fixed wireless access (FWA), and network exposure functions. 

What is the dual-mode 5G?

While the 5G network is swiping across the globe, it actually contains two types of networks, the Non-Standalone (NSA) 5G New Radio and the Standalone (SA) 5G New Radio, depending on how service providers transition from 4G to 5G. The NSA deployments are mostly adopted in early rollouts and faster applications since it is aided by the existing 4G LTE infrastructure to obtain higher speed and provide higher data bandwidth. However, improvements in latency are limited. On the other hand, Standalone 5G will be the main character in facilitating industry digitalization, autonomous vehicles, and robotic surgeries which require low latency and higher capacity. The SA 5G infrastructure is free of the 4G LTE anchor band and taps into greater possibilities for enterprises.

Joint AI Lab

The partnership also includes a joint AI Lab for network automation performance and efficiency trials to be constructed. In addition, FET is set to take part in the Ericsson Startup 5G program, which introduces operators to technology innovation partners to develop next-generation 5G consumer use cases. FET will be able to tap into Ericsson’s ConsumerLab research and analytical data, as well as gain exclusive access to a worldwide network of 5G startups.

Taiwan’s 5G penetration will reach 30% by the end of 2021

“The 5G market is moving extremely fast in Taiwan,” OpenSignal describes in their industry report. And predicts 5G penetration to reach 30% of mobile broadband users by the end of 2021, citing Lexology. By the end of 2021, Chunghua Telecom is aiming for 2 million 5G users, and FET challenging 5G users to reach 30% of total mobile broadband subscribers. But whether the outcome will have a similar figure still depends on the monthly subscription fees set by service providers.

Although the SA 5G New Radio is costly, FET sees a bright outlook for the uprising 5G network empowered industry digitalization. For example, the internet of things, smart manufacturing, telemedicine, self-driving cars, and remote working. And as the technology matures, FET believes the cost will go down over time, and the potential market will boom.

ON NODEMCU ESP32-C3 WIFI & BLE IOT BOARDS SHOW UP FOR ABOUT $4
NodeMCU ESP32-C3 WiFi & BLE IoT boards show up for about $4

ESP32-C3 RISC-V IoT processor with 2.4 WiFI and Bluetooth LE 5.0 was unveiled in December 2020, and Espressif Systems’ own ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1  board has been available in limited quantities as an “engineering sample”.

But now I’ve noticed third-party NodeMCU ESP32-C3 boards are being sold on Aliexpress for around $4 with ESP32-C3S_Kit and ESP-C3-01M-Kit both based on AI Thinker ESP32-C3 modules announced a few months ago.

NodeMCU ESP32-C3S_KIt

Specifications:

Wireless module – AI Thinker ESP32-C3S (footprint compatible with ESP32-S / ESP32-WROOM-32D) with ESP32-C3 RISC-V processor @ 160 MHz, 2.4 GHz WiFi, Bluetooth 5.0 LE, 4MB flash,  on-board PCB antenna, and IPEX connector (which may be soldered or not).
USB – Micro USB port for power and programming via CH340C USB to TTL chip
Expansion – 2x 15-pin headers with GPIO, SPI, UART, ADC, I2S, 3.3V, GND
Misc – RGB LED, Reset key, user-programmable key
Dimensions – 49 x 26 mm
With or without IPEX connector

ESP32-C3S_Kit is also called ESP-C3-32S-Kit with the datasheet available on AI Thinker website. You’ll find the board for $4.29 on Aliexpress, or the just module for around $2.50.

NodeMCU ESP-C3-01M-Kit

This board has pretty much the same features but in a more compact form factor, provided height does not matter, and fewer I/O pins.

ESP-C3-01M kit specifications:

Wireless module – AI Thinker ESP-C3-01M (previously known as ESP32-C3M) compatible with ESP-01M,  with ESP32-C3 RISC-V processor @ 160 MHz, 2.4 GHz WiFi, Bluetooth 5.0 LE, 4MB flash,  and an on-board PCB antenna.
USB – Micro USB port for power and programming via CH340C USB to TTL chip
Expansion – 2x 10-pin headers with GPIO, UART, SPI, ADC, I2S, 3.3V, GND
Misc – RGB LED, Reset key, user-programmable key
Dimensions – Approx 30 x 26 mm

Note that one of the SPI interfaces is gone. Again, you’ll find the datasheet on AI Thinker website. The board is slightly cheaper at $3.55, but in my case shipping is more expensive.

Software support

None of the Aliexpress pages point to software resources for the NodeMCU ESP32-C3 boards. But AI Thinker documentation website has a dedicated section for ESP32-C3 modules and development boards. The company points to the ESP-IDF framework and offers a WeChat applet Bluetooth + WiFi dual control application demo together with source code. There’s no support for NodeMCU Lua firmware at this time.

The documentation also included datasheets for three more boards in a form factor similar to NodeMCU ESP32-C3S_KIt, but with other modules from the company:

ESP-C3-12F_Kit with ESP-C3-12F module equipped with 2MB or 4MB flash, and IPEX antenna connector
ESP-C3-13U_Kit with ESP-C3-13U module equipped with 2MB or 4MB flash, and IPEX antenna connector
ESP-C3-13_Kit with ESP-C3-13 module equipped with 4MB flash, on-board antenna, and IPEX antenna connector

Michigan boutique accidentally tells job applicant she's 'not that cute,' video goes viral

Detroit Free Press

An employer commenting on a job applicant's physical appearance is inappropriate. Accidentally sending an email to the wrong person is often embarrassing. Doing both is a recipe for disaster — and a viral video. 

Gracie Lorincz applied to be a brand representative at Ava Lane Boutique in Auburn Hills. Chuck DeGrendel, VP of operations and the owner’s husband, accidentally sent her an email back commenting on her appearance on Wednesday. The interaction has gone viral on TikTok.

“This girl is fresh out of college (Hope College) and not that cute,” DeGrendel wrote, according to the TikTok. “She applied to the sales model position. Are you sure you want me to interview her?”

Gracie captioned her video “:))))) feeling amazing.”  

The TikTok has accumulated hundreds of thousands of views and likes, as well as thousands of comments as of Tuesday afternoon. It's been up for less than 24 hours.  

Viewers have taken it upon themselves to leave 1-star Google reviews for the company, leaving comments such as, “not that cute” and “Sad that a company whose message is to be inclusive and empower women would base hiring a potential employee off of their appearance. Not a cute look, Ava Lane.”

Chuck and his wife Laura Langen DeGrendel, Ava Lane Boutique’s owner, posted a public apology and a plea for privacy Thursday morning via Facebook Live. 

Chuck explained the situation, saying the company has an open job posting for a brand ambassador position. They usually have a human resources employee review applications, but the HR person is out this week, so Chuck handled it. He intended to send the email to Laura, but he sent it to Gracie instead.

“I sent a reply back to Laura that said that she was a recent college grad and I didn’t feel that she was that cute so I wasn’t sure if we wanted to proceed with an interview,” Chuck said. “I don’t know why I said that, but I did, and I’m very, very sorry for saying that because it was very unprofessional and really not in line with our core values here, or my core values in general.” 

He said he did not realize his mistake until Laura called him a few hours later while he was driving his child to soccer practice. 

“I can only imagine how awful she would feel,” Chuck said. “I’m really, really sorry that I said that. It was wrong to say on many levels, I don’t know why I said it, but I did. And it’s 100% my fault.”

In addition to posting the public apology, Chuck noted he sent a private message to Gracie as soon as he found out what he had done.

Both he and Laura said their entire family has received threats since the post went viral.

“We appreciate your support, we are going to call it a day,” Laura said. “Our phone numbers are out there, our address is out there, our children have been threatened. I’m pretty sure the girl who Chuck just apologized to didn’t mean for her followers to contact us, to threaten our family, I’m pretty sure that was not her intention, but that’s what happened.”

Laura asked viewers to “learn from this” and choose to use social media for good.

Commenters on the DeGrendels’ Facebook Live seem to be torn: some expressed support for the couple and their business while others claimed they are only sorry they got caught.

Gracie's mother, Heather Lorincz, told the Free Press in a message that Gracie is "not trying to harm this business and made no threats whatsoever and did not include a call to action either. She just posted the email and her feelings."

Both Gracie and the DeGrendels could not be reached for comment at the time of publication.

Gracie has since commented on her original post, asking viewers not to threaten the DeGrendels. 

“Hi! This has gotten a lot more attention (than) I had ever imagined,” she wrote. “Thank you so much for the support, but please leave his family out of this.” 

After news of the email and video broke, Chuck DeGrendel posted to Facebook saying he would no longer be involved with model hiring process.

"In light of recent events and after deep personal reflection, I have decided to remove myself from the model hiring process at Ava Lane Boutique and all future hires for such positions at Ava Lane Boutique will be handled by our HR representative. I apologize again for what I said and to anyone I offended. — Chuck DeGrendel"

MINIMUM PERIAPSE FOR A GRAVITY ASSIST
MINIMUM PERIAPSE FOR A GRAVITY ASSIST
2021-07-12adminUncategorized

TLDR: 100 km above the atmosphere

Gravity assists are an astrodynamics maneuver to steal a small amount of a planet’s angular momentum to give your spacecraft a much more significant boost. Exactly how much momentum you can steal is defined by the arrival velocity vector relative to the planet and the maximum turning angle you can achieve, which is given by the following equation

where 

is the velocity relative to the body about which you’re performing a gravity assist,

is the periapse of the flyby relative to the body, and

is the standard 2-body gravitational parameter. As you can see, the maximum turning angle has an inverse relationship with the minimum allowable periapse. Lower one and you raise the other. Many things can affect the minimum allowable periapse (uncertainty of the body’s gravity field or in the spacecraft’s state), but what you need is a general rule of thumb when searching through a large design space. An easy limiting case is it just has to be greater than the bodies radius, but that could get extra dicey for planets with atmosphere

NASA

Searching through the literature did not turn anything up (note, if you have a good paper on this, drop it in the comments, and If I think it is a better source than the current rule of thumb, I’ll update the post). Finally, when asking other astrodynamicists, there was a rough consensus on 100 km above the atmosphere (although no one had a good source on this and some speculation that it was just a nice round number). Now that raises the question of where does the atmosphere “end,” but that’s a conversation I’ll leave to the planetary scientists.

10 things to know before getting into cyber security
Kevin Beaumont
Follow
Jul 4, 2018 · 9 min read

I’
m old. Like super old. Like 36 old. So I thought it might be nice to give back some things which I’ve learnt over the years about InfoSec. Or as we call it now, CyberSec. Which sounds like a really inappropriate IRC moment, if you’re old.

I tweeted a while ago asking people what things they wish they had known before getting into cyber security. I mused on those tweets, and added my thoughts and opinions. Because what the world needs is another blog from somebody you’ve never heard of, right?

Politics

This was by far the popular thing people tweeted at me, all negative sentiment. People said they did not realise the political arena they would be entering.

So here’s the spoiler: there’s very few jobs where you will be doing security for the sake of doing security. Smart organisations want security to enable them to operate securely, which can mean getting out of the way (which can include products and deployment configs which allow people to get on with working).

Some businesses play fast and very loose with security. It’s actually really rare to see an organisation with anything near good security. For many organisations they just cannot realistically afford to run anything near top security — that crab paste company you’re eyeing a cyber job at needs to make crab paste, not have everybody logging in using triple factor SSH keys.

My view with politics is — usually — I actually enjoy it. Not always. The key for me has been learning to try to influence people gently towards a desired outcome — that might take time and patience — and to know when to get over myself and compromise on something to get a better longer term goal or standing within an organisation. A really key one is listening. Sometimes what you’re proposing really isn’t possible with the resources a department/team/company has. Sometimes what you’re proposing isn’t workable for reasons you’ve never even thought of. Sometimes what you’re proposing is just dumb in the real world. And sometimes the arguments an organisation will present against doing something won’t make sense. The key thing is you’ve listened, and you can go away and figure what to challenge, and how.

But, essentially, if you’re getting into the industry thinking most companies have great security and you’re there to enforce the best possible practices of security and there will be little politics: you may have a bad time. Most companies now recognise cyber security as a key risk; that does not mean it is a key focus of a company. And rightly so. Cyber security aren’t there to make a cyber security company, they’re there to enable a company to get back to being that company.

Cyber is a very broad church

Cyber has exploded. Back when I was a kid it was a bunch of hanging out on IRC and visiting Vegas. The idea you would hire a hacker was laughable to most people. It was a small culture of generalists. At my first job, an oil company, whenever I talked about deploying virus software they would ask me if I meant “anti-virus” software. Yes. Because that was my job. But they were convinced it meant something bad.

Nowadays, some organisations have Risk teams, you have Policy, you have red teams trying to break into companies, you have people sat looking at Splunk trying to figure out what is happening to defend their organisations.

It’s worth keeping in mind most every conversation you have internally in departments will be with somebody who looks at something in a specific way. It’s also worth keeping in mind this with online conversations, too. Lots of conversations online go something like “Just patch!”. Which, from a policy point of view, is absolutely right. From the point of view of the people who actually do the patching at scale and manage the systems operationally, “Just patch!” is a bit like saying “Just phone up Taylor Swift and ask her to be your friend”.

This also swings the other way. I was part of a conversation recently with lots of people at lots of UK companies about how to build a great Vulnerability Management team rather than a good one. A great deal of the people had this opinion; you have a dedicated Vulnerability Management team?! Many organisations are still struggling to resource basic patching. It ties into the broadchurch thing; keep in mind what you see and what the person you’re talking to sees, although in theory you’re looking at the same thing, may look very different depending on their experiences.

The security community is pretty terrible at times

B
ack in my youth(tm), we would hang on IRC all day, and then meet up at night for drinks. People knew each other’s real life infos when they met. Trusts were formed. Ideas were exchanged. And, well, lots of idiots were around too.

Many of those people got jobs at big companies, or left the industry.

What is left is a weird shell with lots of different angles. Some of it is brilliant. I like InfoSec Twitter, for example, most of the time as I see material I wouldn’t otherwise. I read almost no InfoSec websites; I exist off a diet of animated GIFs and info drops. I try to never take it seriously.

But there’s a weird atmosphere. I think the Infosec community has gradually eroded, and in it’s place there’s a weird dynamic of self importance emerging, especially post WannaCry as companies seek to find talent.

There’s a lot of punching and drama I try to avoid, particularly on Twitter. I tend to avoid LinkedIn as it appears to be mostly people reposting articles from the press, where I don’t think anybody involved really understands the thing they’re highlighting.

I think there’s a very real echo chamber, too.

My overall feeling is the InfoSec community is beginning to punch down. We’re punching at users, calling them thick. We’re punching a individual social media people for large companies, calling them stupid. We’re punching each other, too.

Now, you may say “Aren’t you the guy who highlighted flaws at Equifax?” Yes I am. They’re a multi-billion dollar Group of companies. I wrote about how the problems they had with Struts could be avoided. Personally I think it’s okay to highlight how large corporations can do better, without picking on people. But this is something I introspect on a lot.

I think ultimately, for me, the community now takes itself very seriously — perhaps too seriously. Twitter is a fun distraction, it can also be great info, but look at the fact I have 47,000 subscribers on Twitter and realise: that is nonsense.

Prepare to earn your place

Lots of people are arriving into cybersecurity. Which is great because fresh people and ideas are absolutely needed — since I started many of the same problems still exist, which is embarrassing. I think there’s a very real lack of diversity in every sense in our industry.

But here’s the thing. I think the number one quality people can bring to the arena is also experience. That doesn’t mean 10 years experience. That means existing in a job and a company and doing the hard work. If you’re really in there, delivering, doing, you’re going to be valuable and won’t have problems finding other jobs in the future. Commit. Do. Deliver.

It’s also worth pointing out many companies are still early in their cyber journey, and some need guidance. Sometimes, you may have to do things which you weren’t expecting in a role. Sometimes, that’s a bad sign. In many cases, it allows you to break free from the box you’re in and get involved in something great. Sometimes you have to gamble and take the lead. My rule is that if you’re doing something which truly aids an organisation in being secure, you’re doing it right.

Write it. Shoot it. Publish it. Crochet it, sauté it, whatever. MAKE.

This isn’t for everyone, but if you’re looking at getting into the industry, you can start a blog and write. Or learn to code and then publish said code.

You will be surprised how many basic tools in InfoSec still don’t exist. For example, through its product life there was no easy central way to report on events from Microsoft EMET. Companies are doing things like associating .vbs files to Notepad as a way of mitigating ransomware attacks, but nobody has written a tool to do this better.

Back in 1998 one of my friends got a Cobalt RaQ 3 during school work experience at Cable and Wireless INSnet. He made me the admin of the box, I reworked the Linux kernel on it to include security hardening patches (I wasn’t a usual teenager…), and we used it for hosting friends projects. I installed VMware on it, and we deployed a Virtual Machine Linux box with no outbound internet access — which we posted credentials to in IRC channels, and then used tcpdump to packet capture people owning the box. In hindsight, it was one of the early honeypots.

From Dave’s work experience, I learnt invaluable Linux admin and security techniques.

My best advice is find a niche, explore it and write about it. If it goes nowhere, either keep at it if it interests you, or find another niche. Nobody has yet nailed cyber security, so it’s a fertile land to explore. If you’re out there, people will find you for employment too.

Have interests outside security

The burn out is real. You will hit a wall. So have interests outside security.

I play video games — my Xbox Live account is 16 years old, which is older than most of the people I play against. I play games like Sea of Thieves, a game which requires voice communication and team work to sail a pirate ship. That’s actually helped me with communication skills, as — for example — there’s no on screen map, so you have to tell people which direction to sail in using compasses, and make sure people are motivated to continue otherwise they just quit.

I also play racing games — I have a full steering wheel setup, despite not having a driving license in the real world. Why? Risk and reward. I’ve crashed and burned by taking risks. I’m now better at judging when to brake.

I guess what I’m saying is other interests can help inform your work — while making sure your head isn’t in one space all the time. If you’re only looking at one thing, you will lose the bigger picture.

There is no set path into InfoSec

This debate flares up on Twitter all the time, with people (including me) saying ‘Get a job on a helpdesk’, and others saying ‘No that’s dumb, get a job straight in InfoSec’. The truth is, there is no set path here and the industry is changing so quickly that paths exist now which didn’t exist 5 years ago, and those may not exist in 5 years if there’s an industry bubble pop. Ultimately: show your worth, show you care, and always be yourself. Unless you suck.

Communication skills matter

Work on how you present things. We live in an age of information overload, so if you’re working with somebody who realistically doesn’t care about what you’re saying — for example, security isn’t their job — try to clearly communicate your thoughts. Often with as little detail as possible, unless they ask for it. And engage people. I do things like lean down at desks when talking to people so I’m below their eyeline, so appear submissive — in my first job they sent me on body language comms courses.

Ultimately, remember, you’re the security person. Your opinion matters, but so does an auditors. Help people see value in concepts and they will see value in you.

Not just technical people are needed

That’s right, cyber needs more humanity and people skills. Desperately. There’s way too many bearded Linux dudes like me. The precious resource which people don’t yet value is people with, well, people and business skills.

Have fun

Cyber can be hilarious. Over the past two decades I’ve been situations people wouldn’t believe. During the WannaCry weekend, while Marcus was trying to fix things (and dodge press by jumping over his garden wall), I sat on conference calls I will likely never detail laughing more than I’ve ever laughed before. It was serious stuff for the UK government, it was ridiculous and fast moving and I didn’t sleep for days.

The day the Locky ransomware first appeared in 2016, I registered a DGA’d domain for it at lunchtime and streamed the failed victims to music from Taylor Swift. Wired Magazine called me for an interview about that. At the time I worked for a company which made bloater paste.

I’m just an idiot with a website, and you’ve just read this, so this industry is hilarious. Enjoy it and all the politics and amazement. Time to die.

Thoughts on Colocation

After a week of slogging servers around northern California, I thought a brain dump on colocation might be useful to readers, and to future me.

I wrote about the difference between colocation, leased servers and other kinds of hosting in an earlier post. This one is strictly about colocation, the 'Condo' approach where you own a bunch of hardware and need a place to put it.

What you are after is not complicated:

A physical enclosure
Some kind of Internet connection
Power
Security guards
However, buying it is a pain in the neck.

Money

It's typical to sign a one- or three-year contract. Right off the bat this introduces an element of pressure, since you're making a fairly binding, long-term decision without knowing what you're doing. Unless you live in the Bay Area, colocation is a cost on par with your rent or mortgage.

Worse, I've found that the cost for identical configurations can vary by a factor of three or more. You really do need to shop around. And you need to be especially careful of punitive terms for things like overstepping bandwidth or power requirements. These are things you have to dig out of the fine print of contracts at a moment when you just want the whole process to be over.

Salespeople

Renting colo space feels like buying a car. You typically decide on a specific configuration you want, and then ask for quotes. For the salespeople involved, this is just the start of a long conversation they want to have with you. They'll be very curious about your budget, and want to talk about the hosting equivalent of an underbody clearcoat (various "hybrid cloud solutions") and extended warranty.

Although colo space is a commodity, salespeople become tetchy if you treat it as such. They will insist on talking to you over the phone and bristle at the suggestion that their job could be replaced by a web form. It is a good idea not to think about how much their salary or commission adds to your costs.

The reason I say colo space is a commodity is not because all facilities are the same, but because small-time clients will have no practical way of assessing their quality. There are certainly some facilities that are obviously bad, but most data centers have sane policies, look nice if you visit, and talk eloquently about uptime. The only way to evaluate a data center is to go through a series of small and big outages together, but by then you're already in a multi-year contract. So in practice, there is not enough information to pick a "better" data center, just a bunch of anecdotes on message boards. I believe you're better off getting space in two cheap places than trying to pick one high-end one.

Resellers

A lot of colo space is resold through intermediaries. This is often the only way to get a smaller amount of space than a full cabinet. Someone rents a bunch of cabinets at a data center and then parcels them out by the slice to clients, in pieces as small as 1u.

There are two things to watch out for in this arrangement:

A bunch of people will have access to your physical equipment. Good resellers will take pains to introduce the various people in a cabinet to one another (or at least provide contact info).
If your provider gets in a dispute with the data center, you may not be able to physically take out your hardware. It may even be seized without advance warning.

Power

Power is the great bugbear in hosting. You need to know how much your equipment uses, and how much you're likely to need. It is also often the limiting factor.

A useful rule of thumb in my case has been 1 rack unit = 1 amp. However, it is quite difficult to estimate the power consumption of a server before you buy it. You end up having to plug it in to a Kill-A-Watt meter under normal load.

A full cabinet is somewhere around 42 units, but a typical full cabinet power allotment is 20 amps. So you can't just fill a cabinet with servers.

The power situation is even worse than it sounds. That 20 amp figure is strictly theoretical, since you aren't allowed to use the full amount. You are limited to 80% of this figure, so a "20A" cabinet has 16A usable power, enough for eight pinboard-style servers.

Finding Datacenters

Finding information is another pain in the neck. The place of choice is an awful forum called WebHosting Talk. There is an open business opportunity to anyone who can stick a front-end interface on this site that lets you enter number of servers, bandwidth, physical location, and spit out a list of offers.

Another business opportunity is to make an authoritative directory of Bay Area data centers, since there is a bewildering assortment of sellers, re-sellers, and re-re-sellers offering the same physical space. Conversely, some large providers maintain multiple facilities.

Earthquakes

Nobody likes to talk about earthquakes. But anything in the Bay Area or Seattle is going to come crashing down at some point. Another thing that has proven impossible is finding out what facilities are at highest risk. It's one thing to go offline when the Big One comes (half the Internet will be down with you). But losing a rack full of hardware into the maw of the earth is worse.

So here's my plea to hackers: figure out where stuff is physically hosted, correlate it with seismic hazard maps, and make a nice web form that lets people shop for specific power/bandwidth/space configurations without talking to salespeople. Charge money for it! I will pay you! Others will pay you!

AI Generated Art Scene Explodes as Hackers Create Groundbreaking New Tools
New AI tools CLIP+VQ-GAN can create impressive works of art based on just a few words of input.

Over the last few months, an AI-generated art scene has exploded as hackers have been modifying an OpenAI model to make astonishing image generation tools.

All you have to do to guide these systems is to prompt them with the image you want. For example, you might prompt them with the text: ‘a fantasy world.’ With that prompt, the author of this article generated the image that you see above.

The crisp, coherent, and high-resolution quality of the images that these tools create differentiate them from AI art tools that have come before. The tools are highly iterative—in the video below, you can see the generation of an image based on the words “a man being tortured to death by a demon.”

The primary engine inside the new tools is a state of the art image classifying AI called CLIP. It was announced in January 2021 by the company OpenAI, renowned for the invention of GPT-3, which was itself announced only in May 2020. GPT-3 can generate text of a truly general, human-like nature, just by feeding it a simple prompt.

While the new CLIP-based systems are reminiscent of GPT-3 in their “promptability,” their inner workings are much different. CLIP was designed to be a narrow-scoped tool, albeit an extremely powerful one. It is a general purpose image classifier that can decide how well an image corresponds with a prompt, for example, matching an image of an apple with the word ‘apple.’ But that is all. “It wasn't obvious that it could be used for generating art,” University of California, Berkeley computer science student Charlie Snell, who has been following the new scene, said in an interview.

But shortly after its release, hackers like Ryan Murdock, a machine learning artist and engineer, figured out how to connect other AIs up to CLIP, creating an image generator. “A couple of days after I started messing around with it, I realized that I could generate images,” Murdock said in an interview. 

Over a series of weeks and months, hackers experimented with connecting CLIP to better and better AIs. On March 4, Murdock succeeded in connecting CLIP and VQ-GAN, another different kind of cutting-edge AI that was posted in a preprint on December 2020. “It took a lot of time to figure out how to make the system work well,” Murdock said. He continued to refine the system until it was able to produce crisp image outputs. Now, combinations of CLIP and VQ-GAN are the most widely used versions of the new tools.

These tools have recently become popular and have led to a new, computer-generated art scene.

“These are the first good ones that’ve been publicly available,” Snell said. “These systems are the first ones that actually sort of meet ‘the promise of text-to-image.’” 

Snell thinks they are perhaps the biggest innovation in AI art since DeepDream, a 2015 AI that became widely used to create hallucinogenic renditions of imagery. “It's definitely the biggest thing I've seen,” Snell said.

Formerly, the most powerful public image generation tools were neural networks called generative adversarial networks, or GANs, of which VQ-GAN is one specific example. After training these networks on a large body of images, they can synthesize new images of a similar type. However, GANs by themselves cannot generate images via prompt. Other sorts of networks besides GANs can do prompting, but not very well. “They just weren’t very good,” Snell said. “This is sort of a novel approach.”

The new tools are readily available to anyone who wants to use them. On June 27, the Twitter user @images_ai tweeted a popular tutorial by the computer scientist Katherine Crowson on how to use one of the latest models. Following the instructions, a savvy user can run the system in a matter of minutes from a web-based programming notebook.

“The results are so shocking that for many they seem to defy belief,” Crowson said in an email. “CLIP is trained on 400 million image/text pairs,” she continued. “At that scale we begin to see abilities we had previously only seen in human artists such as abstraction and analogies.”

There is already a broad body of stunning work. There are beautiful images of abstract sunsets, for example. There are idyllic countryside houses and giant cities, as well. There are weapons depicted with an unsettling animosity, and Escher-type structures that reel away into themselves. 

People have become fascinated by the capabilities of the tools and artists have begun to widely adopt them. “There’s a lot of buzz about it on machine learning and art Twitter,” Murdock said. 

Users have started to develop an artistry specific to the tools. One of the quirks of the systems is that you must figure out how to optimize your prompt to generate an image closest to your intention. Snell has watched on his Twitter feed as artists have gradually evolved how they prompt.

“They're constantly trying new tweaks to it to try to make it better,” Snell said. “And it is getting better. Every week, it feels like there's some improvement they find.”

The new tools do have limitations, such as the size of their generated images. The images themselves can often be unexpected and weird. But the fact that the tools could be built at all was a surprise.

On the same day they announced CLIP, OpenAI also announced a powerful AI called DALL·E that was directly designed for image generation. They released a handful of its results, which made it appear akin to a true image generation analog of GPT-3, something that expertly created images of anything. However, DALL·E was not released to the public, neither its code nor the production AI, which was likely highly expensive to train. By contrast, OpenAI released the CLIP model in its entirety. “The hardware to produce these neural nets is relatively inexpensive,” Crowson said. 

ADVERTISEMENT

The new tools have shown that CLIP provides a kind of backdoor method to reproducing the abilities of DALL·E. Given the fact that OpenAI withheld DALL·E, it would seem that the company might have been caught off guard. “I definitely suspect that they're a little bit surprised that it could do all this,” Murdock said. 

Snell described it this way: “They teased us with DALL·E. They were like, ‘We have this thing.’ And they didn't release it,” he said. “And everyone was like, ‘We want it though.’ So then they just sort of made it themselves.”

The hacked together CLIP-based tools work very differently from DALL·E. DALL·E directly produces images that correspond with text. Instead, Snell describes the CLIP-based systems as something more like AI interpretation tools. As VQ-GAN and CLIP work together, the first model builds an image, and the second model says how well it matches the prompt. The two iterate until the image matches the prompt best. The iteration says something about the imagery that CLIP associates with certain words.

The CLIP-based models are therefore an entirely new kind of art tool, a new kind of computer paint brush. They do not quite feel like a perfect one yet, Snell points out. “You have some control over it, but you can't fully control it. And you're always like, a little bit surprised.” But that human-like quality of ingenuity is a big part of the new tools’ appeal.

It remains to be seen what impact they will have. It seems as though it will be easy for companies and collaborations to improve the tools greatly, given that the current ones have been made mostly by individuals. But they are already very powerful. Many people seem likely to adopt them for art, work, and fun. Creating art has now become as simple as using language, enabling anyone to be their own kind of lyrical Picasso.

Super Mario 64 game sells for record-breaking $1.5m at auction

HERITAGE AUCTIONS

A sealed copy of video game Super Mario 64 has sold at auction for more than $1.5m (£1.1m), shattering records.

The 1996 cartridge was a launch title for the Nintendo 64 console, and was one of the most influential early 3D platformers.

The auction house said there were "fewer than five" copies in such good condition.

The sale dwarfed another record-breaker, an original Legend of Zelda cartridge, set just two days before.

That original Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) cartridge sold for $870,000 on Friday, briefly making it the world's most expensive game.

Neither game was bought for the rarity of its gameplay experience - Nintendo has rereleased both for its Nintendo Switch console.

Instead, they have value as physical memorabilia, in the same way as rare trading cards.

How do you work out what something is worth?

The Super Mario 64 cartridge was graded by video game collectable firm Wata at a 9.8 A++ rating - meaning it is both in near-perfect condition and its seal is intact and "like new".

A high rating is not enough to guarantee a high auction price - although it helps. Another copy of Super Mario 64 in the same auction with a 9.6 A++ rating sold for a comparatively affordable $13,200.

But rarer copies of more popular games attract the most bids.

Super Mario 64 was the best-selling game for the Nintendo 64 system, and is widely seen as an important game in video game history. It marked Mario's first move into three dimensions, distinct from his side-scrolling origins.

While many modern gamers feel it has not aged particularly well and is widely thought to have significant camera issues, it is still considered among the best video games ever made. Heritage Auctions, the company behind the sale, was taken by surprise at the huge price it eventually attracted.

Ahead of the auction, much of the attention had been on the rare Zelda cartridge.

The 9.0 A-sealed copy of 1988's The Legend of Zelda was the first game in the series, and has gone on to be one of the best-performing and most critically-acclaimed in Nintendo's entire catalogue.

It was expected to reach a high price because this copy belonged to an early production run - making it one of the first ever made to still exist. Heritage Auctions said that to its knowledge, only one earlier production copy is known to exist, and may never be put on sale.

"This copy [is] the earliest sealed copy anyone can realistically hope to obtain," it wrote.

Many expressed surprise that the Mario cartridge - which sold millions and millions of copies - sold for so much.

Kelsey Lewin, a director at California's Video Game History Foundation, tweeted: "despite a lack of population reports, there are many known sealed Super Mario 64 first prints".

Video game collectables have been fetching higher and higher prices, leading some to question whether the market is over-inflated.

The sale of the Zelda cartridge shattered the previous record, set in April for an original NES cartridge of Super Mario Bros, Mario's first outing, which sold for $660,000.

The record-breaking auction this week saw a huge range of collectable games go for high prices - a copy of Final Fantasy III for the Super Nintendo sold for $96,000, as did a copy of Zelda: A Link to the Past.

A PHALLUS FOR THE AGES —
Archaeologists “flabbergasted” to find Cerne Giant’s origins are medieval
"Everyone was wrong, and that makes these results even more exciting."

JENNIFER OUELLETTE - 7/12/2021, 7:51 AM

The Cerne Abbas Giant is a 180-foot-tall figure of a naked man wielding a large club, carved with chalk into a hilltop in Dorset, England. The figure's generously sized erect phallus has earned it the nickname "Rude Man," and no doubt contributes to its popularity as a tourist attraction. Archaeologists have long speculated over exactly when, and why, the geoglyph was first created. Now, thanks to a new analysis of sediment samples, they have narrowed down the likely date for the Rude Man's creation to the late Saxon period—a surprising result, since no other similar chalk figures in the region are known to date from that time period.

"This is not what was expected," said geoarchaeologist Mike Allen, who has been working with the National Trust on the ongoing project to learn more about the Cerne Abbas Giant. "Many archaeologists and historians thought he was prehistoric or post-medieval, but not medieval. Everyone was wrong, and that makes these results even more exciting."  National Trust senior archaeologist Martin Papworth told the Guardian he was "flabbergasted" by the results: "I was expecting 17th century.”

In the 1990s, archaeologists relied on soil samples to date another well-known geoglyph—the 360-foot-long Uffington White Horse in Oxfordshire—to between 1380 and 550 BC. And the Long Man of Wilmington in East Sussex dates back to the 16th century.  "Archaeologists have wanted to pigeonhole chalk hill figures into the same period," said Allen. "But carving these figures was not a particular phase—they’re all individual figures, with local significance, each telling us something about that place and time."

The Cerne Abbas Giant was formed by cutting trenches two feet deep into the steep hillside, and then filling them with crushed chalk. Some scholars believed the giant might date back to the Iron Age as a fertility symbol. Local folklore holds that copulating on the giant's crotch will help a couple conceive a child, and there is an Iron Age earthwork known as the Trendle at the top of the hill in which the giant has been carved. However, there is no mention of the figure in a 1540s survey of the Abbey lands, nor in a 1617 survey conducted by the English cartographer John Norden.

The earliest known written reference to the Cerne Giant appears in a 1694 warden's account from St. Mary's Church in Cerne Abbas, recording the cost of three shillings to repair "ye Giant." There are also references to the figure in a 1734 letter by the then-Bishop of Bristol, and a 1738 letter by antiquarian Francis Wise. The first survey to mention the giant was published in 1763 and included measurements and a drawing. After that, mention of the giant becomes far more common in the historical record.

Cerne Abbey was founded in 987 AD, and given the evidence for a medieval origin date, it's possible that the giant was created to help convert local inhabitants from worshiping the early Anglo-Saxon god Heil (or Helith). However, Papworth is skeptical of this theory. "Why would a rich and famous abbey—just a few yards away—commission, or sanction, a naked man carved in chalk on a hillside?" he said.

Others have suggested the giant is a depiction of Hercules, citing evidence that the figure may have once worn a cloak, in keeping with traditional depiction of the demigod. Or perhaps it was created in the 17th century as a parody of Oliver Cromwell, who was sometimes mocked as "England's Hercules" by contemporaries.

Last year, the National Trust announced that soil samples taken from the figure included species of microscopic snails introduced to the region during the medieval period, in keeping with the new findings. For this latest analysis, the team relied upon a technique known as Optically Stimulated Luminescence, which involved subjecting the samples to laser light. That light released trapped particles, and by measuring their concentrations, it was possible to calculate when individual grains in those samples were last exposed to sunlight. That in turn enabled researchers to infer a likely date of origin.

The deepest samples—taken from the giant's elbows and feet—rule out a prehistoric Roman origin, indicating that the giant was probably first made by late Saxons sometime between 700 and 1100 AD. However, other samples indicate a later date of around 1560—still predating the first recorded mention of the giant in the 1694 church warden's account.

According to Papworth, it's possible that people have been re-chalking the Rude Man over a very long period of time, which would explain the different dates, as well as all the evidence suggesting the giant's features have changed over time. A 2020 LIDAR scan, for instance, revealed that the impressive phallus had been added much later—perhaps when the figure was recut as a Cromwell parody in the 17th century.

"I wonder whether he was created very early on, perhaps in the late Saxon period, but then became grassed over and was forgotten," Papworth said. "But at some stage, in low sunlight, people saw that figure on the hill and decided to re-cut him again. That would explain why he doesn’t appear in the abbey records or in Tudor surveys."

Being able to narrow down the date for the Cerne Abbas Giant is an impressive feat, but there is always more to learn about the figure. "Future research could tell us even more about how he changed over time, and whether our theory about his ‘lost’ years is true," said Papworth. "When we began the work, some people wanted the giant’s age to remain a mystery—but archaeologists want to use science to seek answers. We have nudged our understanding a little closer to the truth, but he still retains many of his secrets. He still does have an air of mystery, so I think everyone’s happy."

AHOY —
How much shipping can we get through a warming Arctic?
Research discusses the logistic, social, and ecological impacts of a warm Arctic.

DOUG JOHNSON - 7/11/2021, 9:30 AM

Traveling by boat through Canada's Arctic waters is no easy feat. Beyond the ice and the cold, the region is one of the most complex geographies on Earth, containing some 36,000 islands of varying size. But the nature of the Arctic is shifting thanks to climate change, and according to new research, the nautical pathways through the region are likely to become easier to traverse as the world warms and its ice becomes less common.

The new paper projects how navigable the Canadian Arctic will be in a progressively warmer world. The research began in 2017 and was performed in an effort to model climate change in a way that was digestible and useful for policymakers and people living in Arctic communities. "We need to think about indicators at a local scale, or a decision-making scale," said Jackie Dawson, one of the paper's authors and a professor in the University of Ottawa's department of geography, environment, and geomatics.

While the paper also looks into the policy and social implications of different warming scenarios, we would be better off if we kept the climate from warming. The likelihood of reaching some of the paper's more dire scenarios "[depends] on what actions we take in the future, is what it boils down to," Lawrence Mudryk—a research scientist with Environment and Climate Change Canada and one of the paper's authors—told Ars.

Setting a course for 4º C

To figure out how Canada's area of the Arctic would respond to increasing temperatures, the team ran a climate model several times, each time with a slightly different set of factors. Through this process, the team saw the expected conditions of Arctic ice when the world reaches 1º C (where we currently are, more or less), 2º C, or 4º C above pre-Industrial Revolution levels. The researchers also looked into the amount of time each year in which the Arctic would be open for shipping for different classifications of vessels, such as icebreakers and passenger ships.

The paper also breaks these findings down by region within the Arctic along major trade routes like the Northwest Passage, for instance. The extent to which the warming impacts each region varies. As temperatures rise, the sea ice will thin and recede, and more of the region will be navigable via ship throughout more of a given year.

So, for example, in the case of 2º C of warming, there is a 100 percent probability of each type of vessel identified in the study being able to navigate the Northwest Passage and Arctic Bridge trade routes for at least part of a year. Moreover, some places will be navigable for longer. The Beaufort Sea region, for instance, could see a dramatic lengthening in terms of its shipping seasons: 100 to 200 days at 2º C, and 200 to 300 days at 4º C.

Pros and (mostly) cons

The paper also discusses how these scenarios could impact Arctic communities, since using these insights and the paper's scenarios can help policymakers plan accordingly. In environmental terms, hitting, say, 4º C is bad news, but there are benefits—it's easier to move products via ship through the Arctic, for instance. Further, if the Arctic opens up, it would be easier to resupply the maritime Inuit communities up North by boat.

Dawson noted that, just because there is more shipping throughout the Arctic, that doesn't necessarily mean that Inuit and northern communities will necessarily reap any of the benefits from this potential increase in traffic. "Communities are going to be affected very differently depending on where they are. There will be both opportunities and risks," Dawson said. "We tried to focus on the question: 'What does this mean for the future of resupply to communities?'"

However, they could see a tourism boost from people with passenger boats. Further, if there's less ice in the Arctic, it's possible that the area that keeps a healthy amount of ice will be turned into a reserve for various Arctic species, which could also be a draw—a kind of "last-change tourism" opportunity, Mudryk said.

More ships, more problems

Communities in the region could also face more environmental issues as a product of the increased shipping—on top of the negatives associated with changes to the climate. Subsistence hunting is a major source of food in the region, since shipping food there is so difficult. The decrease in ice and increase in ships could push animals farther away from the communities, harming food security.

The ice is expected to grow thinner as the climate warms, which is something of a safety concern for people walking or hunting on it, Dawson noted. Boats could also bring invasive species with them—either through ballast exchange or hull fouling. Previously, the cold kept many invasive species away, but if the Arctic gets warm enough, they may be able to thrive.

According to John Walsh—a professor at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, who has worked with the Arctic Council's Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme—even if the ice does let up, there will still be risks for ships in the area. "It's not going to be like the Suez Canal," he told Ars. Boats are still likely to crash, get grounded, or otherwise spill their contents in the region. And, in areas as remote as Canada's Arctic, cleaning up after an accident is particularly difficult.

"In a remote region like that, how you handle an accident or a spill is a real challenge," he said.

vintage - a declarative API for C++ audio plug-ins

This is an experiment in seeing how far modern C++ features allow to write purely declarative code and introspect this code through various reflection-like features.

Aeon for Friends

In the town of Dayton, Ohio, at the end of the 19th century, locals were used to the sound of quarrels spilling out from the room above the bicycle store on West Third Street. The brothers Wilbur and Orville Wright opened the shop in 1892, shortly before they became obsessed with the problem of manned flight. Downstairs, they fixed and sold bicycles. Upstairs, they argued about flying machines.

Charles Taylor, who worked on the shop floor of the Wright Cycle Company, described the room above as ‘frightened with argument’. He recalled: ‘The boys were working out a lot of theory in those days, and occasionally they would get into terrific arguments. They’d shout at each other something terrible. I don’t think they really got mad, but they sure got awfully hot.’

We’re so familiar with the fact that the Wright brothers invented the aeroplane that the miraculous nature of their achievement goes unheralded. Wilbur and Orville were not scientists or qualified engineers. They didn’t attend university and they weren’t attached to any corporation. In fact, before their breakthrough, they’d accomplished little of note. So, just how did they come to solve one of the greatest engineering puzzles in history? Their success owes a lot to their talent for productive argument.

The brothers, four years apart, were close. ‘From the time we were little children,’ wrote Wilbur, ‘my brother Orville and myself lived together, worked together, and in fact, thought together.’ But that should not be taken to mean they had the same thoughts; the way they thought together was through argument. It was their father, Milton Wright, who taught them how to argue productively. After the evening meal, Milton would introduce a topic and instruct the boys to debate it as vigorously as possible without being disrespectful. Then he would tell them to change sides and start again. It proved great training. In The Bishop’s Boys (1989), his biography of the brothers, Tom Crouch writes: ‘In time, they would learn to argue in a more effective way, tossing ideas back and forth in a kind of verbal shorthand until a kernel of truth began to emerge.’ After a family friend expressed his discomfort at the way the brothers argued, Wilbur, the elder, explained why arguing was so important to them:

No truth is without some mixture of error, and no error so false but that it possesses no element of truth. If a man is in too big a hurry to give up an error, he is liable to give up some truth with it, and in accepting the arguments of the other man he is sure to get some errors with it. Honest argument is merely a process of mutually picking the beams and motes out of each other’s eyes so both can see clearly…

Wilbur Wright’s description of collaborative intellectual enquiry is one the ancient Greeks would have recognised. Socrates believed that the best way to dispel illusions and identify fallacies was through the exchange of arguments. His took place in the town square of Athens, often with the city’s most respected intellectuals. His favoured technique was to invite someone to say what they believed (about the nature of justice, say, or happiness) before asking them why and how they could be so sure. Eventually, under persistent questioning, the fragility of the intellectual’s initial confidence would be revealed.

Agnes Callard, associate professor of philosophy at the University of Chicago and an expert on the ancient Greeks, says that Socrates was responsible for one of the founding innovations of Western thought: what she calls the ‘adversarial division of epistemic labour’, in which one party’s job is to throw up hypotheses, while the other’s is to knock them down. This is exactly what happens in a modern courtroom as prosecutor and defender co­operate in a quest for justice by ripping each other’s arguments apart. Even though Socrates himself was sceptical of democracy as a form of government, the idea that people with different views can vigorously yet co­operatively disagree is essential to democratic society.

Today, I believe we’re in danger of losing touch with this principle. Open disagreement is associated with personal animus, stress and futility, partly because we see so many toxic fights on social media. Thanks to the popularisation of research into the flaws of human cognition, we’ve also become increasingly aware of how hard it is to argue without ‘biases’, such as the tendency to pick a side and stick to it rather than weighing evidence for different views dispassionately. It can be tempting, then, to avoid open argument altogether, but this merely transforms our differences into sullen resentment, while depriving us of a powerful tool of enquiry. An alternative is to propose that, when debates do take place, they should be fastidiously civil, emotionally detached and unimpeachably rational.

But the Wright brothers didn’t argue politely or dutifully. They took delight in verbal combat, throwing themselves into every battle. ‘Orv’s a good scrapper,’ said Wilbur, fondly. In another letter, Wilbur chastised a friend for being too reasonable: ‘I see you are back to your old trick of giving up before you are half-­beaten in an argument,’ he wrote. ‘I felt pretty certain of my own ground but was anticipating the pleasure of a good scrap before the matter was settled.’

The Wrights were on to something. We shouldn’t avoid robust, passionate, biased argument. In fact, under the right conditions, it can be the fastest route to truth. A good scrap can turn our cognitive flaws into collective virtues.

I
n 1966, the English psychologist Peter Wason introduced a simple experimental design that has since gone on to have an enduring impact on the study of human reasoning. The Wason Selection Task works like this. Imagine these are four cards, flat on the table, each with a number or letter on the other side:

Your task is to prove the following rule true or false: ‘All cards with a vowel on one side have an even number on the other side.’ Which card or cards do you need to turn over to test this rule?

Take a minute to think about it.

In Wason’s experiment and in numerous replications since, about 80 per cent of people pick two cards: E and 4. That’s the wrong answer. Turning over 4 doesn’t actually tell you anything; the rule doesn’t state that consonants can’t be paired with even numbers. The correct answer is to turn over E and 7, since those are the only two cards that can prove the rule false. If there is an odd number on the other side of E, or a vowel on the other side of 7, then the case is closed.

It might seem like a trivial mistake but, ever since Wason published his results, the fact that most people flunk this task has been taken as powerful evidence that human reasoning has a fundamental flaw: we’re strongly inclined to search for evidence that confirms our beliefs (or in this case, that confirms the supposed rule), rather than to look for ways to disconfirm them. This flaw has since gained a catchy name – confirmation bias – and become one of the most well-evidenced findings in psychology.

It’s been replicated in countless ways. In a landmark 1979 study, psychologists recruited students who had firm views for or against the death penalty, and then presented them with two reports of equally rigorous fictitious studies that seemed either to support or undermine the hypothesis that capital punishment deters crime. Next, the researchers asked the students to assess the robustness of the two studies. As you might have guessed, the students showed favouritism toward the methodology of whichever paper supported their own initial view.

Reasoning makes us smarter only when we practise it with other people in argument

Humans have an instinctive aversion to the possibility of being wrong. Armed with a hypothesis, we bend reality around it, clinging to our opinions even in the face of evidence to the contrary. If I believe that the world is going to hell in a handcart, I’ll notice only bad news and screen out the good. Once I’ve decided that the Moon landings were a hoax, I’ll watch YouTube videos that agree with me and reason away any counter­evidence that might cross my path. Intelligence is no protection from confirmation bias, nor is knowledge. In fact, clever and knowledgeable individuals have been shown to be more prone to it, since they’re better at finding reasons to support what they already believe, and more confident in their own mistaken views.

Confirmation bias would seem to be a big problem for our species because it makes us more likely to deceive ourselves about the nature of the world. It also makes us more likely to fall for the lies of those who tell us things we are already predisposed to believe. ‘If one were to attempt to identify a single problematic aspect of human reasoning that deserves attention above all others, the confirmation bias would have to be among the candidates for consideration,’ wrote Raymond Nickerson, a psychologist at Tufts University, in 1998.

This raises a tough question. The ability to reason is meant to be humanity’s supreme attribute, the characteristic that most sets us apart from other animals. Why, then, has evolution endowed us with a tool so faulty that, if you bought it from a shop, you’d send it back? The French evolutionary psychologists Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber have offered an intriguing answer to this question. If our reasoning capacity is so bad at helping us as individuals figure out the truth, they say, that’s because truth­-seeking isn’t its function. Instead, human reason evolved because it helps us to argue more effectively.

Homo sapiens is an intensely collaborative species. Smaller and less powerful than other primates – weedy, compared with our Neanderthal forebears – our human ancestors nevertheless managed to dominate almost any environment they set foot in, mainly because they were so good at banding together to meet their needs. Given the importance of cooperation to our survival, we’ve evolved a finely tuned set of abilities for dealing with each other. In Mercier and Sperber’s view, reasoning is one of those social skills.

In the debate over the nature of human intelligence, Mercier and Sperber are ‘interactionists’, as opposed to ‘intellectualists’. For intellectualists, the purpose of our reasoning capacity is to enable individuals to gain knowledge of the world. In the inter­actionist view, by contrast, reason didn’t evolve to help individuals reach truths, but to facilitate group communication and co­operation. Reasoning makes us smarter only when we practise it with other people in argument. Socrates was on to something.

I
n most studies, the Wason Selection Task is completed by individuals working alone. What happens when you ask a group to solve it? That’s what David Moshman and Molly Geil, of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, wanted to find out. They assigned the task to psychology students, either as individuals, or in groups of half a dozen. As a third condition, some individuals were given the test alone, and then joined a group. The results were dramatic: the success rate of groups was 75 per cent, compared with 9 per cent for individuals.

Ever since Wason himself ran the experiment, it has been repeated many times with many different volunteers, including students from elite universities in the US, and with participants offered a cash bonus for getting the right answer. Yet the results have always been pitiful; rarely did more than 20 per cent of people pick the correct cards. Moshman and Geil vastly improved people’s performance at the task simply by getting them to talk it through. It’s as if a group of high-jumpers discovered that by jumping together they could clear a house.

This is a surprise only if you take the intellectualist perspective. If reasoning is a fundamentally social skill, it’s precisely what we should expect. Moshman and Geil’s analysis of the group discussions further supports the interactionist view. One member of the group would be the first to work out the correct answer, and then the rest of the group would fall into line, but only after a debate. It’s not that one person got to the right answer and everyone immediately agreed. Truth won out only after an exchange of arguments.

The answers that emerge will be stronger for having been forged in the crucible of our disagreement

While humans have accumulated a vast store of collective knowledge, each of us alone knows surprisingly little, and often less than we imagine (for instance, we tend to overestimate our understanding of even mundane items, such as zips, toilets and bicycles). Yet each of us is plugged into a vast intelligence network, which includes the dead as well as the living; the more open and fluid your local network, the smarter you can be. Moreover, open disagreement is one of the main ways we have of raiding other people’s expertise while donating our own to the common pool.

Sperber and Mercier argue that, looked at through the interactionist lens, confirmation bias is actually a feature, not a bug of human cognition. It maximises the contribution that each individual makes to a group, by motivating them to generate new information and new arguments. Think about what it’s like when someone contradicts you. You feel motivated to think of all the reasons you’re right and the other person is wrong, especially if it’s an issue you care about. You might be doing so for selfish or emotional reasons – to justify yourself or prove how smart you are. Even so, you’re helping the group generate a diversity of viewpoints and then select the strongest arguments. When you bring your opinions to the table and I bring mine, and we both feel compelled to make the best case we can, the answers that emerge will be stronger for having been forged in the crucible of our disagreement.

Perhaps, rather than trying to cure the human tendency to make self­-centred arguments, we should harness it. This is a principle understood by the world’s greatest investor, Warren Buffett. When a company is considering a takeover bid, it often hires an investment banking firm to advise on the acquisition. But this raises a conflict of interest: the bankers have a strong incentive to persuade the board to do the deal. After all: no deal, no fee. In 2009, Buffett proposed that companies adopt a counter­balancing measure:

It appears to me that there is only one way to get a rational and balanced discussion. Directors should hire a second advisor to make the case against the proposed acquisition, with its fee contingent on the deal not going through.

The genius of this approach lies in the fee. Buffett doesn’t just advise getting a second opinion; he advises giving the second advisor a financial incentive to win the argument. Why? Because by doing so, the directors can harness the power of biased thinking, even as they guard against their own. The second advisor is now strongly motivated to think of as many good reasons as it can that the deal should not go through. The board will then have generated a set of arguments for and a set of arguments against, and be in a stronger position to make the right call.

I
ncentives don’t have to be financial, of course. Tribalism – the desire to see our group win – is usually portrayed, for good reason, as the enemy of reasoned thought. But it can also be an aid to it. In 2019, a team of scientists led by James Evans, a sociologist at the University of Chicago, published their study of a vast database of disagreements: the edits made to Wikipedia pages. Behind every topic, there is a ‘talk page’ that anyone can open up to observe editors debating their proposed additions and deletions. The researchers used machine learning to identify the political leanings of hundreds of thousands of editors – whether they were ‘red’ or ‘blue’ – based on their edits of political pages. Here’s what they discovered: the more polarised the editorial team, the better the quality of the page they were working on.

Ideologically polarised teams were more competitive – they had more arguments than more homogeneous or ‘moderate’ teams. But their arguments improved the quality of the resulting page. Editors work­ing on one page told the researchers: ‘We have to admit that the position that was echoed at the end of the argument was much stronger and balanced.’ That ‘have to’ is important: the begrudging way that each side came to an agreement made the answer they arrived at stronger than it otherwise would have been. As Evans’s team put it: ‘If they too-easily updated their opinion, then they wouldn’t have been motivated to find counter­-factual and counter-data arguments that fuel that conversation.’

Pursuing a strongly held conviction, even when it’s wrong, can still be productive at the group level. It’s an elegant paradox: in order for a group to reach rational conclusions, at least some of its individual members should argue a little irrationally. When everyone feels compelled to generate arguments and knock down competing arguments, the weakest arguments get dismissed while the strongest arguments survive, bolstered with more evidence and better reasons. The result is a deeper and more rigorous process of reasoning than any one person could have carried out alone. Emotion doesn’t hinder this process; it electrifies it. By allowing their arguments to run hot, the Wrights were able to beat all the experts in the world.

It’s pointless having a group of smart people around a table if all they do is nod along with each other

Open and wholehearted argument can raise the collective intelligence of a group, but the chemistry of a disagreement is inherently unstable. There’s always a possibility it might explode into hostile conflict or vaporise into thin air. Self­-assertion can turn into aggression, conviction can become stubbornness, the desire to co-operate can become the urge to herd. I’ve sat around tables at work where most people don’t express a strong point of view and simply accept whatever the most confident person in the room says, or just nod along with the first opinion offered because it seems like the nice thing to do. The result is a lifeless discussion in which the dominant view isn’t tested or developed.

I’ve also sat at tables when different individuals fight their corner, sometimes beyond the point that seems reasonable to do so. That kind of debate can be enormously productive; it can also, of course, tip over into an ego battle that generates more heat than light. Over centuries, we’ve developed processes and institutions to stabilise the volatility of disagreement while unlocking its benefits, modern science being the foremost example. It’s also possible to create these conducive conditions ourselves, as the Wikipedians and the Wrights show us.

The first condition, of course, is to openly disagree. The members of the group must bring their own opinions and insights to the table, rather than just adopting those of whomever they like the most or nodding along with the dominant voices in the room. The more diverse the pool of reasons and information, the greater the chance of truly powerful arguments emerging. It’s pointless having a group of smart people around a table if all they do is nod along with each other.

A second condition is that the debate should be allowed to become passionate without becoming a shouting match. How did the Wrights get hot without getting mad? Ivonette Wright Miller, a niece of the brothers, identified a vital ingredient, when she noted that the brothers were adept at ‘arguing and listening’. The tougher that Wilbur and Orville fought, the more intently they listened. Good listening can be a function of close and respectful personal relationships, as in the case of the Wrights, or from tightly structured discussions that force everyone to attend to other viewpoints, as in the case of the Wikipedians.

Third, the members of the group must share a common goal – whether that be solving a puzzle, making a great Wikipedia page, or figuring out how to get a plane in the air and keep it there. If each member is only defending their own position, or trying to get one ­up on everyone else, then weaker arguments won’t get eliminated and the group won’t make progress. Each one of us should bring our whole, passionate, biased self to the table, while remembering that our ultimate responsibility is to the group. What matters, in the end, is not that I am right but that we are.

Amazon wants to build an autonomous car army​

This best patent applications of the week.

Karyne Levy  July 11, 2021

Big Tech didn't disappoint this week, with a few patent applications that made me do a double take. Google wants to make the content of photos searchable, Amazon wants to build an army (of autonomous cars), Apple wants to help you party, and Facebook loves straps.

And remember: The big tech companies file all kinds of crazy patents for things, and though most never amount to anything, some end up defining the future.

Alphabet

Photo search engine

I don't have any allergies, but I have family and friends who are allergic to everything from gluten to peanuts to sesame seeds. Menus often have little notations next to items that may contain gluten or nuts. But not always, and that can be scary.

This patent imagines a way for you to take a picture of something, and your phone acts as a search engine, using the information in the picture as the "search term." In the example images, a full menu is depicted, including chips and salsa in the appetizer section. The patent describes how the phone turns the text into a selectable box. If you click on chips and salsa, it could access information you gave it up front (in this case your allergies), compare it to the list of ingredients, and then alert you if there's something that might make you have a reaction. And if you don't have any allergies, you could use this system to find pictures of chips and salsa, recipes for chips and salsa, and maybe even the best nearby place to get chips and salsa.

Now I want chips and salsa.

Amazon

A little army of delivery vehicles

This patent is blowing my mind. Autonomous delivery vehicles are becoming more popular, with companies like Nuro getting permission to launch a fleet of driverless cars to make local deliveries. But, as this patent notes, autonomous delivery equipment, such as sensors, navigation equipment and processors, can be very pricey. And if the car itself is small, all the equipment might not leave much room for groceries.

Instead, this patent imagines one car acting as a primary car, housing all the necessary equipment and sending commands to other vehicles that don't need all that equipment. The primary car could send a bunch of other cars off to do other deliveries. In the end, there's just a little army of autonomous cars being directed by one primary car, and I don't know about you, but that sounds both cool and terrifying.

Apple

Music party

Being in charge of the music at a party is a little intimidating. You have to make sure that the good vibes remain constant, that the volume isn't too annoying, and that you are playing the right mix of music to make everyone happy.

This patent imagines a way for one phone to hook up to speakers around the house, but other people can pair their phones to control playback and volumen, so that the burden of being a great DJ doesn't fall on one person. Or if a bunch of people are watching Netflix streamed by one phone, but everyone could connect so that everyone is in charge of the remote.

Facebook

Research tool for workplace emotions

Companies rely on employee surveys to get a general sense of how people feel about different aspects of the company. But those surveys take time and effort, and getting a 100% return rate is difficult. Facebook wants to personalize and streamline gathering employee sentiment data by programming chatbots to see how employees are feeling about their workplace. Employees can choose to talk to a chatbot at any time of day, engage in natural conversations, and the chatbot could gather and analyze the data. I imagine people would rather vent to a chatbot than try to rank how they feel on a scale of 1-10.

Similarly, Facebook wants to scrape social media data to tell a brand whether the brand is being destroyed on social media, which could lead to stock prices falling. That way the brand can act appropriately and quickly.

Big week for straps

Last week Facebook filed a patent for a yarn strap; this week, Facebook wants to create a way to attach various straps to the VR device. This way, multiple people can use the device and personalize how the strap fits.

Stop winging it: Business communications has become even smarter than you think
Anthony Bartolo, Avaya  July 1, 2021

The only thing consistent about today's consumers is that they don't present a consistent face to businesses, so most companies can't rely on just a couple customer journeys to determine what consumers want and need. Progressive businesses are now deploying AI-powered customer experience platforms to enable them to manage the increasing complexity and challenges of customer interactions.


One driver of this complexity is generational differences, which businesses have had to consider for many decades. The rapid pace of change, however, has further increased the technology gap between generations. Many boomers grew up in a household with no television or one black-and-white television with just a handful of channels, and businesses communicated with customers via mail and telephone. But look what's happened since.

SPACE TRAVEL
Richard Branson went to space on Sunday. When’s it your turn?

Space tourism can cost anywhere from $20 million to $50 million, but soon it could cost closer to $20,000 to be able to yell "I'm an astronaut!" with confidence.

The time has come. Richard Branson is the first billionaire founder of a space company to be shipped off to suborbital space on Sunday on a ship he helped build. The trip on the VSS Unity will last around 90 minutes, and he'll be bringing three colleagues with him. Branson's main duty on the trip: to figure out how to make the trip even more fun for the people who go after him.

And people will, indeed, go after him. Virgin Galactic has already sold around 600 tickets for similar flights, and plans to send at least 400 people per year to space starting in 2022.

The new wave of global trade: How Alipay connects US businesses with Chinese consumers
Kate Silver  July 10, 2021
Douglas Feagin, SVP, Global Strategic Partnerships & Investments, Ant Group
 

On a recent visit to a CVS near his home in Vero Beach, Florida, Douglas Feagin realized he forgot his wallet. It was an old habit, really. Feagin, who is a senior vice president of the China-based fintech company Ant Group, usually spends a great deal of time in Asia, where his phone doubles as his wallet. "I don't ever use my wallet in China. The phone is your payment mechanism," he said. But here, in the United States, he promptly returned home to get his wallet (only Chinese citizens can use the Alipay app to make payments outside of China).

In fact, China leads most markets in its adoption of mobile payments, and Ant Group owns and operates one of the country's largest e-wallets, Alipay, which has more than 1 billion users. Alipay facilitates transactions both online and in physical retail stores. In 2020, U.S. brands sold $54 billion worth of products to Chinese consumers online through Alibaba's ecommerce platforms – sales that were facilitated by Alipay.

U.S. retailers accepting Alipay can also reach the Chinese customer at their stores in China as well as their stores here in the United States. Indeed, prior to COVID-19 travel restrictions, between April 2019 and March 2020 the Alipay app facilitated $232 million in transactions made in person by Chinese travelers at U.S. businesses.

The Crypto Movement Is Destroying Itself
It's falling apart

When the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto published his white paper in 2008, it was just a mere document, describing a new, unique payment system he called Bitcoin. Yet, even though he did not portray any particular narrative inside, it prompted an entire generation of financially repressed citizens into believing that digital currencies might solve their ever-increasing monetary woes.

We began to perceive the Bitcoin network as a revolutionary economic tool, one that used sound money to create a more equal society through enhanced financial freedom and liberty. It was the new, rebellious way to stick it to the man, an escape pod that detached ourselves from the clutches of a financially repressive regime, and, best of all, a gigantic “screw you” to those who architected its rise and our descent into the monetary chaos.

Since then, the financial media has fed us a constant stream of crypto narratives, most declaring that the world is moving closer toward this brighter, more sovereign, more liberating future that Nakamoto indirectly sold to us. We’ve seen the rise of crypto influencers, or “cryptofluencers”, who often cheer things like: “The fiat system is collapsing!”, “Bitcoin is financial freedom!”, “Central bankers and Wall Street are literally shaking in their boots!”

Except, there’s one small problem with these narratives. None are coming true or have played out in reality. Instead, they have matured into carefully constructed fictions, disguising how Bitcoin has failed at almost everything Nakamoto set out to achieve. Since the crypto ecosystem keeps blurting out a non-stop stream of “freedom porn”, we’ve failed to notice that the crypto movement, though it started out with good intentions, has gradually mutated into the same regressive paradigm the existing elites have promoted for decades.

Nakamoto had designed Bitcoin to eliminate the middleman, mostly Wall Street banks, state financial institutions, and mega-corporations, which most citizens loathe and despise. Bitcoin has succeeded in doing this, but it has failed to create any of the delicious freedom, equality, and liberty it had promised. Rather, only a few individuals have truly benefited from the crypto boom. In fact, a new power has risen alongside the existing financial aristocracy: the crypto elite, who’s secretly formed a monopoly behind the scenes.

They did this by perpetuating the myth of decentralization. Just because nobody owns Bitcoin and it’s “unstoppable”, does not mean the Bitcoin network can’t be dominated and manipulated by bad actors. In 2015, five men who owned 80% of global mining operations stood on the same stage, and since then, four to five firms have dominated the market. The latest figures, which came out just before China’s recent crypto crackdown, showed that nine Chinese companies controlled 79% of the Bitcoin network.

This is just mining. It gets worse.

If you thought Bitcoin could solve the wealth inequality epidemic, the top 10,000 addresses own roughly 60% of all mined coins. As for liberating the people from Wall Street’s financial monopoly, over 60% of crypto traders choose to use Binance or another cartel exchange, which means they don’t actually possess a crypto wallet nor do they interact with the blockchain. Who works for, promotes, and owns these exchanges? Who holds most of the $BTC? It’s the crypto elite. It’s the crypto whales. It’s the cryptofluencers who peddle the decentralization narrative. They’ve added “Crypto” to the end of JPMorgan’s logo, forming a new-age finance monopoly.

Who are these mysterious, elusive individuals sitting at the apex of the crypto pyramid? Are they honest characters, law-abiding global citizens who advocate transparency and authenticity, like Nakamoto said they’d be? Not at all. Over time, the “legit side” of Wall Street and the corporate world have spat out bad actors, who have snuck their way into the crypto ecosystem, slowly corrupting it from the inside.

Is #Tether’s house of cards about to unravel? (feat @Bitfinexed, @CryptoWhale, @BennettTomlin) https://t.co/IA309pBYMi

June 29th 2021

9 Retweets47 Likes

This is a tweet, directed at this author, from Stuart Hoegner, the lawyer of Bitfinex, one of the largest exchanges and players in the crypto space today. Yet it’s a corporation that, among other things, has been banned from New York for alleged fraud, has used bots and sockpuppets on social media to alter public perception, and has lied about having sufficient reserves to back up its parent company’s stablecoin Tether.

Hoegner himself used to run compliance at Excapsa, the parent company of Ultimate Bet, the nefarious online poker room that enabled specific players to view other player’s cards. Now, he represents infamous members of the crypto elite, such as Tether co-founder Brock Pierce.

He’s portrayed as a rockstar, a philanthropist, but Pierce has a shady history. Not only has he met up with Jeffrey Epstein multiple times, for some reason, but he’s also set up “charities” just to take advantage of tax havens. After moving to Spain in 1999 with pedophile Marc Collins-Rector (as you do), Interpol caught Pierce in a house full of “guns, machetes and child pornography”. He also ran for President. Crazy, but fitting — if you think about it.

Pierce, however, has some serious competition for the most “controversial character in crypto”, the media’s hilarious new euphemism for James Bond-esque supervillains of the crypto world. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, known as “CZ”, says his company has no headquarters. That’s because the world’s largest crypto exchange is too busy jumping from country to country to bypass laws and regulations. It had started in Hong Kong but got banned. Then it tried Japan, Bermuda, Malta, and the Cayman Islands, but everyone said “nada”. Binance remains under investigation by the IRS, the DoJ, and the CFTC, plus Japanese, British, and Canadian regulators. Slowly but surely, the net is tightening around CZ’s $2 billion crypto empire.

Helping to portray a positive perception of “controversial” characters like CZ are crypto influencers. Another group that makes up the crypto “Illuminati”. Take Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano, Dan Held, and others you see on Twitter — who constantly update us on Bitcoin’s price, seemingly every time it goes up by another thousand dollars. It’s their job to promote the false narratives around Bitcoin to line the pockets of other crypto elite members. They must spin every piece of crypto “FUD” into a positive to help maintain the status quo, and their wealth, which is mostly tied to crypto-based investments and hype.

These are the major players in a movement that’s supposed to be ridding the world of financial inequality and tomfoolery, yet they engage in endless amounts of it, almost on steroids. The greed that has corrupted Wall Street and the Fed, producing our sorry situation of bailout capitalism and casino economics, has worked its way into crypto land. The lust for power and wealth, it’s sad to say, has started plaguing new-age finance.

But nothing illustrates the crypto elite’s desire to increase their power more than the recent rise of “crypto colonialism”. A New York Times article entitled “Making a Crypto Utopia” details how our friend Brock Pierce plans to erect a city slap bang in the middle of Puerto Rico.

“They’re going to buy 250,000 acres so they can incorporate their own city,” says ex-pat Rob Rill, “literally start a city in Puerto Rico to have their own crypto world.”

Pierce’s “cryptopia” is not even the major developing story, however, with El Salvador’s Bitcoin fever stealing the spotlight. Though the popular Bitcoin Beach project has proven to be a success, with American ex-pat Michael Peterson enabling El Zonte’s locals to use Bitcoin as an alternative payment method, the sudden declaration from El Salvadorian President Nayib Bukele that Bitcoin will become legal tender raises serious questions.

After hinting years before that he might make the move, Bukele has teamed up with several Bitcoin Bros to make it happen.

Now, if you’re a hardcore crypto maximalist you’ll perceive El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption as a liberation, a way for citizens to free themselves from the U.S. empire and its allies. The opposing view, however, is that this is another episode of blockchain colonialism. If the Bitcoin revolution embodies freedom and liberty, you don’t set up shop in a “developing” country, become best buddies with their autocratic leader, and, together, force people onto a monetary system they have no power to oppose or flee.

The El Salvador drama shows that the crypto elites are becoming less like freedom fighters and more like anarchistic clones of the Wall Street mobsters they sought to overthrow. In fact, if Bitcoin had worked as Nakamoto proposed, no crypto elite would have emerged at all, let alone a rising power initiating a mass dash into the developing world, using it as a crypto-imperialistic Petri dish.

While the crypto elite gallivants around the globe, the crypto community, watching in awe as their leaders expand their empire, keep fighting it out among themselves. Divisiveness now governs a so-called pro-autonomy, pro-liberation movement. We’ve seen multiple religions emerge from Bitcoin maximalism to Ethereum maximalism to stablecoin maximalism. Not only are there cults but cults within cults, and we must only join one, creating rabid tribalism, the same centralized, regressive dogma that’s caused division throughout history. We’re striving to achieve “coin supremacy”, over which coin is “best”. It’s even entered the altcoin or “shitcoin” universe, creating a clusterfuck of mob mentality.

The drama surrounding Robert Breedlove, a moderate cryptofluencer, illustrates this absurd culture war dynamic. When he dared to question his religion, posting a tweet promoting Bitclout, an open-source blockchain “like Bitcoin” — oh the horror, his fellow but not-so-fellow disciples attacked him for such blasphemy as to promote — yikes! — another cryptocurrency.

“I am not a Toxic Maxi, nor am I even a Bitcoin Maximalist,” Breedlove said, “I am striving to be a Sovereign Individual and my highest value is Freedom. I am a Freedom Maximalist.”

Despite him doing zero research on Bitclout, he was drenched in a sea of toxic abuse, not just from trolls, but from prominent Bitcoiners, who accused Breedlove of “shilling” the “shitcoin” and being paid to promote it. “Bitcoin privacy figure Matt Odell accused me of cultivating an affinity scam”, Breedlove wrote, “saying that I would die on the bitclout hill”. Neil Jacobs, another prominent Bitcoin maximalist replied to Matt Odell’s tweet: “Well said!”. The demon inside every crypto zealot had exploded.

This and other supremacy wars only increase the crypto elite’s ever-increasing power. Just as we’re components in Wall Street’s machine, we’re plebs in the crypto elite’s rising order. It’s our anger and passion that fuel it. They feed us freedom and liberty porn through social channels and the media. They peddle crypto versions of the legacy financial system as rebellious breakthroughs, such as yield-farming, a Ponzi scheme replica of traditional fractional reserve banking, while pocketing the big bucks through fees.

Let’s face it. With the crypto supremacy wars fueling more division and inequality, the Bitcoin elite wreaking havoc on a global scale, and the community abandoning Nakamoto’s sound money vision to participate in Ponzi schemes, it’s sad but true: the crypto movement is slowly destroying itself.

Coming to terms with this is difficult. We’ve yet to acknowledge the shitstorm occurring both behind the scenes and front and center. We don’t want to believe it’s a carefully constructed illusion of freedom because we’re high on hope and euphoria. We’re too blinded by optimism and greed to peek behind the curtain.

If the crypto movement was accomplishing anything, right now, we’d be experiencing a different reality. We’d fail to witness a huge speculative bubble in the crypto market. We’d care about Bitcoin and its principles, not whether it’s going “TO THE MOON!”. We’d neither “HODL” until we reach one million, nor witness regular pump-and-dumps that create new victims every day.

We’d strive to achieve price stability, not “pRicE Go Up”, understanding that if Bitcoin did climb to six or seven figures, the most vulnerable would be left holding the bag, with crypto’s first adopters running for the exit hatch.

We’d watch sound money advocates rise to officialdom, not a rampant onslaught of cryptofluencers who get rich off the hype. We’d see the influential crypto bugs, such as the Winklevoss twins, Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano, and What Bitcoin Did’s Peter McCormack promote sound money, help combat fraud, and enforce reputable markets.

Instead of filling up our Twitter feeds with thousand-dollar-increment Bitcoin price alerts, they’d be tweeting about how prices remain stable. They’d address the sketchy areas of crypto, like how Tether, a stablecoin backed by almost nothing, has fueled most of the latest crypto rally. They’d want to banish its dodgy founders and its Wall Street-esque shadow reserves from the crypto ecosystem, not support it, and declare obvious red flags as “FUD”.

(And, best of all, they’d stop sounding like members of a strange cult.)

Since we’re failing to witness any of this happen, however, the crypto dream is crumbling. But is it dead?

What if we’re early? What if we’re experiencing the Wild West stage of crypto and have yet to battle through the chaos that brings order? Maybe, when this mania ends, Bitcoin’s real price will be revealed, it will become less volatile and highly liquid, and will wipe out all the crap of this cycle, never to be seen again. This is a long shot, of course, but let’s face it: Out of the tools we possess to rid the system of crony capitalism, crypto is still our best shot.

The crypto movement, however, has begun to merge with the very order and power structure it set out to defeat, and there are no signs of a reversal. The only way back now is a monumental crypto purge, a colossal unwind where Bitcoin stands strong and upholds capitalism’s supposed best qualities of eliminating bad actors and bad ideas. If we fail to experience a “reset” soon, the crypto paradigm will replace the legacy monetary order, but with a stronger, more powerful, more technocratic elite shaping its financial agenda, not the people who Satoshi Nakamoto set out to empower.

Small derp.

Coins move without keys on chain. Narrative changes. Crypto economy collapses, DeFi dies. BitcoinSV emerges from the ashes like a phoenix.

I enjoyed reading this. I also enjoyed your Tether write up a week ago. Is there any chance you could share your thoughts about USDC? They have been growing massively the last year. Is it as safe as people think? Or another Tether in the making?

Invisible Ink Could Reveal whether Kids Have Been Vaccinated

The technology embeds immunization records into a child’s skin

By Karen Weintraub on December 18, 2019
M.I.T. engineers have developed a way to store medical information under the skin, using a quantum dot dye that is delivered, along with a vaccine, by a microneedle patch. The dye, which is invisible to the naked eye, can be read later using a specially adapted smartphone. Credit: Second Bay Studios

Keeping track of vaccinations remains a major challenge in the developing world, and even in many developed countries, paperwork gets lost, and parents forget whether their child is up to date. Now a group of Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers has developed a novel way to address this problem: embedding the record directly into the skin.

Along with the vaccine, a child would be injected with a bit of dye that is invisible to the naked eye but easily seen with a special cell-phone filter, combined with an app that shines near-infrared light onto the skin. The dye would be expected to last up to five years, according to tests on pig and rat skin and human skin in a dish.

The system—which has not yet been tested in children—would provide quick and easy access to vaccination history, avoid the risk of clerical errors, and add little to the cost or risk of the procedure, according to the study, published Wednesday in Science Translational Medicine.

“Especially in developing countries where medical records may not be as complete or as accessible, there can be value in having medical information directly associated with a person,” says Mark Prausnitz, a bioengineering professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who was not involved in the new study. Such a system of recording medical information must be extremely discreet and acceptable to the person whose health information is being recorded and his or her family, he says. “This, I think, is a pretty interesting way to accomplish those goals.”

The research, conducted by M.I.T. bioengineers Robert Langer and Ana Jaklenec and their colleagues, uses a patch of tiny needles called microneedles to provide an effective vaccination without a teeth-clenching jab. Microneedles are embedded in a Band-Aid-like device that is placed on the skin; a skilled nurse or technician is not required. Vaccines delivered with microneedles also may not need to be refrigerated, reducing both the cost and difficulty of delivery, Langer and Jaklenec say.

Delivering the dye required the researchers to find something that was safe and would last long enough to be useful. “That’s really the biggest challenge that we overcame in the project,” Jaklenec says, adding that the team tested a number of off-the-shelf dyes that could be used in the body but could not find any that endured when exposed to sunlight. The team ended up using a technology called quantum dots, tiny semiconducting crystals that reflect light and were originally developed to label cells during research. The dye has been shown to be safe in humans.

The approach raises some privacy concerns, says Prausnitz, who helped invent microneedle technology and directs Georgia Tech’s Center for Drug Design, Development and Delivery. “There may be other concerns that patients have about being ‘tattooed,’ carrying around personal medical information on their bodies or other aspects of this unfamiliar approach to storing medical records,” he says. “Different people and different cultures will probably feel differently about having an invisible medical tattoo.”

When people were still getting vaccinated for smallpox, which has since been eradicated worldwide, they got a visible scar on their arm from the shot that made it easy to identify who had been vaccinated and who had not, Jaklenec says. “But obviously, we didn’t want to give people a scar,” she says, noting that her team was looking for an identifier that would be invisible to the naked eye. The researchers also wanted to avoid technologies that would raise even more privacy concerns, such as iris scans and databases with names and identifiable data, she says.

The work was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and came about because of a direct request from Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates himself, who has been supporting efforts to wipe out diseases such as polio and measles across the world, Jaklenec says. “If we don’t have good data, it’s really difficult to eradicate disease,” she says.

The researchers hope to add more detailed information to the dots, such as the date of vaccination. Along with them, the team eventually wants to inject sensors that could also potentially be used to track aspects of health such as insulin levels in diabetics, Jaklenec says.

This approach is likely to be one of many trying to solve the problem of storing individuals’ medical information, says Ruchit Nagar, a fourth-year student at Harvard Medical School, who also was not involved in the new study. He runs a company, called Khushi Baby, that is also trying to create a system for tracking such information, including vaccination history, in the developing world.

Working in the northern Indian state of Rajasthan, Nagar and his team have devised a necklace, resembling one worn locally, which compresses, encrypts and password protects medical information. The necklace uses the same technology as radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips—such as those employed in retail clothing or athletes’ race bibs—and provides health care workers access to a mother’s pregnancy history, her child’s growth chart and vaccination history, and suggestions on what vaccinations and other treatments may be needed, he says. But Nagar acknowledges the possible concerns all such technology poses. “Messaging and cultural appropriateness need to be considered,” he says.

BIOPASS RAT: New Malware Sniffs Victims via Live Streaming

We discovered a new malware that targets online gambling companies in China via a watering hole attack, in which visitors are tricked into downloading a malware loader disguised as a legitimate installer for well-known apps such as Adobe Flash Player or Microsoft Silverlight. Closer examination of the loader shows that it loads either a Cobalt Strike shellcode or a previously undocumented backdoor written in Python, a new type of malware that we found to be named BIOPASS RAT (remote access trojan).

BIOPASS RAT possesses basic features found in other malware, such as file system assessment, remote desktop access, file exfiltration, and shell command execution. It also has the ability to compromise the private information of its victims by stealing web browser and instant messaging client data.


What makes BIOPASS RAT particularly interesting is that it can sniff its victim’s screen by abusing the framework of Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) Studio, a popular live streaming and video recording app, to establish live streaming to a cloud service via Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP). In addition, the attack misuses the object storage service (OSS) of Alibaba Cloud (Aliyun) to host the BIOPASS RAT Python scripts as well as to store the exfiltrated data from victims.


We consider BIOPASS RAT as still being actively developed. For example, some markers that we discovered during our analysis refer to different versions of RAT code, such as “V2” or “BPSV3”. Many of the loaders that we found were used to load Cobalt Strike shellcode by default instead of the BIOPASS RAT malware. Furthermore, BIOPASS RAT also creates scheduled tasks to load the Cobalt Strike shellcode during the initialization, indicating that the malicious actor behind the attack still heavily relies on Cobalt Strike.


We also found several clues that show how the malware might be connected with the Winnti Group(also known as APT41).


In this blog entry, we will dive deeper into BIOPASS RAT with a detailed technical analysis of the infection chain, the different components of the malware, and any possible associations with Winnti.


Infection chain


The initial delivery mechanism of BIOPASS RAT uses of a watering hole, a compromised website in which the malicious actors inject their custom JavaScript code to deliver malware. In most of the cases that we observed, the attackers usually place their injection script in their target’s online support chat page.

Figure 1. The login panel of BIOPASS RAT
Figure 2. Code showing the watering hole attack injection

The injected script will try to scan the affected host by sending HTTP requests to a list of ports. If it receives any response with an expected string from these ports, the script will stop. This step is likely designed to avoid attacking an already infected victim.

We found that the BIOPASS RAT has the ability to open an HTTP service running on localhost on a port chosen from a hard-coded list. This functionality allows the script to identify whether the victim has already been infected by their malware. It conducts this identification by testing whether the port is open or not and then by checking the response.

Figure 3. The script used to check for existing BIOPASS RAT infections

If the script confirms that the visitor has not yet been infected, it will then replace the original page content with the attackers’ own content. The new page will show an error message with an accompanying instruction telling website visitors to download either a Flash installer or a Silverlight installer, both of which are malicious loaders. It is important to note that both Adobe Flash and Microsoft Silverlight have already been deprecated by their respective vendors.

The legitimate known application is downloaded and executed. Authenticode-signed files are either downloaded from the official websites (as seen in sample c47fabc47806961f908bed37d6b1bbbfd183d564a2d01b7cae87bd95c20ff8a5) or are hosted on Alibaba Cloud OSS on the attackers’ account.

Visual C++ runtime, a legitimate and signed vc_redist.x??.exe, and Python runtime are then downloaded.

These files are also hosted on Alibaba Cloud OSS on an attacker-controlled account. The Python runtime is usually a ZIP file with all required executables, as well as the DLL and Python libraries necessary for running Python scripts on machines where Python is not installed.

Scheduled tasks that are activated on a new login are created. These tasks can run a BPS backdoor or a Cobalt Strike loader. 


Figure 8. Code excerpt from the scheduled task

We also noticed the path string “ServiceHub”, which is a path to the extracted Python runtime. After the hex decoding of the arguments, we get a Python one-liner that downloads additional Python scripts from the cloud.

Figure 9. Python code for downloading additional components from Alibaba Cloud OSS
Figure 10. The BIOPASS RAT infection flow
Examining the BIOPASS RAT modules

We observed a few scheduled tasks being created, with the number dependent on the analyzed sample. In the following section, we provide an analysis for each important backdoor module.

The cdaemon module


One of the modules used is called “cdaemon”. At the time of our research into this threat, only the “print(1)” command is able to be executed. An old sample of the module (30ccfbf24b7c8cc15f85541d5ec18feb0e19e75e1e4d2bca9941e6585dad7bc7) is likely a watchdog to check the status of another module that is known as “c1222”.


The malicious actors can change this behavior by replacing the content of the cdaemon.txt service in the cloud so that when combined with the regular execution of the scheduled task, the cdaemon task can behave like a backdoor.


Figure 11. The content of the cdaemon.txt backdoor
The c1222 module

The second scheduled task is called “c1222.txt,” which is a Python code run by a previously downloaded Python runtime. This code runs an HTTP server that listens on predefined ports. If accessed by an HTTP client, it returns a marker value.

Figure 12. The list of predefined ports to bind an HTTP service to, which is reversed

After accessing the infected machine with an HTTP server bound to a predefined port, the module returns the marker value.

Figure 13. The HTTP service with marker BPSV3

We also observed other markers — such as, “cs_online”, “online”, and “dm_online”. The purpose of the HTTP service is to act as a marker for an infected machine to avoid repeated infection, as aforementioned in the infection chain section. The most important task of the c1222 script is to download, decode, and execute the Cobalt Strike shellcode. Based on the platform, it downloads a file with an encoded shellcode (sc3.txt, x64.txt), and then decodes it (the shellcode is base85 and hex-encoded).

Figure 14. Decoding the Cobalt Strike shellcode
The big module (BIOPASS RAT)

The third scheduled task —is called “big.txt”— is responsible for implementing the BIOPASS RAT malware. This is a Python-based backdoor that is distributed in plain text or compiled with Nuitka or PyArmor and PyInstaller.

When the malware starts, it checks whether the file with the hard-coded name “%PUBLIC%/20200318” exists. This file is a marker to determine if the scheduled task of the backdoor has been installed.


If the file (that is, the marker) is not found, the backdoor creates a new one and writes the current timestamp onto it. The malware will then delete the scheduled tasks added by the loader and add two new scheduled tasks that are listed in Table 1.

Table 1. The scheduled tasks created by BIOPASS RAT
 

The BIOPASS RAT malware loads a Python script, “online.txt” that will open an HTTP server that listens on one of the following port numbers: 43990, 43992, 53990, 33990, 33890, 48990, 12880, 22880, 32880, 42880, 52880, or 62880. The HTTP server does nothing but returns string “BPSV3” to request.


A second HTTP server will also be created to listen on one of the aforementioned port numbers. The second HTTP server behaves the same as the first but returns a string, “dm_online”, instead. These are the markers of infection as previously mentioned. After the servers are established and running, the backdoor creates an execution root directory in the folder “%PUBLIC%/BPS/V3/”.


Figure 15. The script of a simple HTTP server to return string “dm_online”

If the malware finds that the system username is “vbccsb”, it will stop. It must be noted that “vbccsb” is the default username on ThreatBook Cloud Sandbox, a popular alternative to VirusTotal in China.

If the backdoor finds that the file “debug” present inside the root directory, it will wait for 130 seconds and then continue with execution.


Figure 16. The script used to check the username and debug mode

Next, the backdoor will try to read the file “bps.key” inside the root directory. This file contains the victim ID assigned by the command-and-control (C&C) server. If the file hasn’t been created, it will set the victim ID to a null value until the C&C server assigns it.

At the end of initialization, it collects the information of the victim’s system and initializes values in the global config variable that contains important configuration information. This includes the backdoor version (we observed V2 and V3), access keys, endpoint address, the bucket name for Alibaba Cloud OSS, and a URL for downloading the utility sc.exe that is used for taking screenshots.


Figure 17. The BPS backdoor global configuration variable

The backdoor communicates with the C&C server using the Socket.io protocol. The C&C communication is encrypted with AES ECB algorithm using a hard-coded password, ZLIB compression, and base85 encoding.

Figures 18 and 19 show how the malware sends the “join” event to initialize C&C communication and attach the victim’s encrypted data.


Figure 18. Encoded “join” event sent to the C&C server
Figure 19. Decoded “join” event sent to the C&C server. It’s important to note that attributes like IP address, computer and username, architecture, installed antivirus, and geolocation are included.

The BIOPASS RAT malware registers three custom Socket.io event handlers:


1.      The “notice” handler is used for checking the connection with the C&C server. The backdoor regularly sends a “notice” event to the server and records the timestamp if it also receives a “notice” event as the response. If the malware doesn’t receive any “notice” event within a hard-coded threshold period, it will restart.


2.      The “set key” handler is used for accepting the victim ID, a random string with six characters, assigned by the C&C server. It will be attached in each of commands sent from the server and will also be used as the folder name on a cloud storage service to save the stolen data. The victim ID will be stored in the “bps.key” file.


3.      The “accept task” handler is the main handler used to process the command sent from the C&C server and to return the execution result. We share more details of each command in the next section.

After the malware joins the C&C server, the server will assign a victim ID with “set key” event and send multiple “accept task” events with the commands “ScreenShot”, “SnsInfo”, “PackingTelegram”, “GetBrowsersCookies”, “GetBrowsersLogins”, “GetBrowsersHistories”, and “GetBrowsersBookmarks” to instruct the malware to collect private data from the victim.

Table 2. BIOPASS RAT commands

 

OpenEverything


The malware downloads “Everything” files if the “Everything” binary is not found in the “%TEMP%” folder. It then changes the port number of the HTTP server inside the configuration file and starts the Everything process, which will open an HTTP server to allow the threat actor to access the file system of the victim.

OpenFFmpegLive


The malware downloads FFmpeg files if they are not found on the victim’s machine. Next, it starts the FFmpeg process to monitor the victim’s desktop via RTMP live streaming to the cloud. The malicious actor can then connect to the relevant RTMP address to watch the streaming.

Open_Obs_Live


The malware downloads OBS Studio files if the OBS folder and config file are not found in the root directory. It writes the basic config and RTMP config of OBS and then starts the OBS process to monitor the victim’s desktop using RTMP live streaming to the cloud. The malicious actor can connect to the relevant RTMP address to watch the streaming.

Figure 20. The script used to download OBS Studio, prepare the configuration, and start the process
ScreenShot

The malware downloads the screenshot-cmd tool if it is not found in the root directory. It takes a screenshot of the victim’s screen with the tool and saves it as a PNG file with a random number as the file name.  The malware will then upload the screenshot files to cloud storage.

Shell

The malware uses a number of methods to execute the shell command or script. The “Shell” command instructs the malware to execute a command using the Python function “win32api.ShellExecute” and to return the result to a C&C server, applying a 60-second timeout for command execution.

If the command has one of the following prefixes, it will perform a specific behavior:

1.      “subprocess”: executes a system command using the Python function “subprocess.Popen”.

2.      “python”: executes a Python script delivered with the command.

3.      “noreturn”: executes a system command using the Python function “win32api.ShellExecute” without waiting for the result.

4.      “getversion”: returns the string “20200202”.

5.      “restart”: kills the process itself and restarts it via scheduled malicious tasks.

SnsInfo

The command will list the installation directory of several popular instant messaging applications including WeChat, QQ, and Aliwangwang and return this information to the C&C server. Figures 21 and 22 show the result of running “SnsInfo” command to enumerate messengers.

Figure 22. Decoded SUBMIT RESULT command sent to C&C server

None of the Chinese messenger applications has been installed on our testing machine, which explains the result seen in the images.


GetBrowsersCookies


This command is designed to steal cookie information from browsers. It will read the “Local State” file to grab the AES secret key of Google Chrome-based browsers. Depending on the different argument “type” delivered with the command, it performs different behaviors.

If the value of the “type” argument is “Chrome”, it will use the AES secret key or DPAPI (for Chrome versions before 80) to decrypt the cookie file. The decrypted result will be sent to the C&C server. 


Figure 23. The script to decrypt Chrome’s file with AES or DPAPI decryption

If the value of the “type” argument is “File”, it will directly upload the cookie file to cloud storage. The command that we received showed that the targeted browsers include Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge Beta, 360 Chrome, QQ Browser, 2345 Explorer, Sogou Explorer, and 360 Safe Browser.

Figure 24. Code showing the command to target Sogou Explorer
GetBrowsersLogins

This command has a nearly identical function to “GetBrowsersCookies”, although it targets a browser’s “Login Data” files instead.

Additional Findings on BIOPASS RAT


Although these are not implemented inside the BIOPASS RAT malware, we have observed two additional plug-ins that are written in Python (“getwechatdb” and “xss_spoof”) and were deployed by the threat actor to a victim who had been infected with Cobalt Strike.

The script “getwechatdb” is used for exfiltrating the chat history from the WeChat Windows client. The script will detect the version of the installed WeChat client and grab the decryption key and the user ID. The predefined list of offsets is used to locate where the decryption key and the user ID are embedded. The list supports 36 different versions of memory offsets for the message client.


The script will then upload database files inside the WeChat folder including “MicroMsg.db” to cloud storage. These database files are used for saving the chat history. Finally, the script will print out the client ID and the decryption key that allows the malicious actors to decrypt the stolen database files of the chat history.

The other plug-in, “xss_spoof”, is an archive that contains multiple Python scripts. The scripts are designed for web server infection via a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. This plug-in can inject malicious scripts into the response of the victim’s web server by leveraging the WinDivert package, which is used to sniff and manipulate the network traffic on Windows.

The scripts intercept HTTP GET requests that are sent to port 80. An “ignore” list is used to filter the file extensions of URLs to avoid manipulating resources that are not JavaScript or HTML. The script then modifies the original JavaScript or HTML content and delivers it to website visitors.


 

Figure 27. The JavaScript payload used to replace the original script of compromised websites

The delivered script is almost the same as the malicious script previously discussed in the section on the watering hole attack. The script performs checks by scanning localhost to determine if the machine is infected by BIOPASS RAT while showing the fake updated webpages. It is likely that the malicious actors compromised the web servers first and then ran “xss_spoof” for propagation.

Potential links with the Winnti group

We have found several connections between BIOPASS RAT and the Winnti Group:

1.      We discovered that many BIOPASS RAT loader binaries were signed with two valid certificates. However, these certificates are likely stolen from game studios from South Korea and Taiwan. It is well known that the Winnti Group has previously used stolen certificates from game studios to sign its malware.

Table 3. Information from the stolen certificates
 

2.      While checking the stolen certificates, we found a server-side variant of the Derusbi malware sample (e5fdb754c1a7c36c288c46765c9258bb2c7f38fa2a99188a623182f877da3783) that was signed with the same stolen certificate.


Derusbi is known to be used by multiple advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. The server-side variant has also been noted to be used as a malware loader by the Winnti Group.

3.      We found an interesting Cobalt Strike loader (a7e9e2bec3ad283a9a0b130034e822c8b6dfd26dda855f883a3a4ff785514f97) that embeds a URL that leads to the BIOPASS RAT loader. However, the URL is unused and was likely left inside the loader as a mistake. This file has also been mentioned in a recent report that connects it to an attack on a major certification authority (CA) in Mongolia.

The Cobalt Strike loader, which has a PDB string “C:\Users\test\Desktop\fishmaster\x64\Release\fishmaster.pdb”, connects to the C&C server “download[.]google-images[.]ml”. The domains and the PDB string have been mentioned in a recent report and have been attributed to the Winnti Group.

While these connections allow us to link the malware to the Winnti Group, the different targets between BIOPASS RAT and the current operations by Winnti’s that we are tracking makes associating the two more difficult.

BIOPASS RAT highlights the importance of downloading from trusted sources

BIOPASS RAT is a sophisticated type of malware that is implemented as Python scripts. It possesses many features, such as the ability to use scheduled tasks as a method of maintaining persistence in the infected system.  The malware abuses publicly available tools and cloud services for its malicious behavior.  Notably, a large number of features were implemented to target and steal the private data of popular web browsers and instant mes\sengers that are primarily used in Mainland China.

Given that the malware loader was delivered as an executable disguised as a legitimate update installer on a compromised website, we advise users to be careful  with regard to the applications that they download. As much as possible, it is recommended to download apps only from trusted sources and official websites to avoid being compromised by attacks such as the one discussed here.

Organizations can also help protect their end users by implementing security solutions that provide  a multilayered defense system that helps with detecting, scanning, and blocking malicious URLs.

Note that we’ve submitted an abuse report to Alibaba, but we have yet to receive feedback at the time of publication.

An Overview Of Computer Science Concepts For Engineers
2017-03-05 - By Robert Elder
Who Should Read This?

     This article is targeted at engineering majors from disciplines other than software engineering (such as electrical or mechanical) who are interested in learning more about what topics exist in the field of computer science and software engineering.  You may also benefit from this article if you graduated from a computer science program more than 10 years ago, since this field is rapidly changing and there may be new concepts that you haven't heard of before.

     Various theoretical topics will be mentioned, but particular emphasis will be placed on those topics which are especially relevant in today's job market.  This article is optimized for people who are already very technical, mathematical and fast learning.  This article is not intended to teach you any of these topics, but instead to let you know that they exist and explain why they are important so you can go learn them on your own.

Computer Science Theory
A Turing Machine is an important theoretical model of computation that is used by computer scientists to make claims and proofs about how powerful certain languages and computational systems are.  It is related to the concept of Turing completeness.
The Von Neumann architecture is an important model for implementing actual physical computers that also provides the benefits described by the more theoretical Turing machine.  Previous to the Von Neumann architecture, computers were physically hard-wired to perform calculations is a specific sequence, but with the Von Neumann architecture, they could be re-programmed by changing the data in their memory instead of physically re-wiring them.
Real computational machines are usually classified as either register machines or stack machines.
Big O notation is a notation used to describe the eventual dominating growth rates of functions.  It is used heavily in the study of asymptotic complexity as a method of comparing which algorithm will make a more favourable use of resources (usually memory or CPU).
NP-completeness is a term used to describe a collection of problems for which there is currently no known way to solve quickly.  Specifically, the only way we know how to solve them requires a run time that go up exponentially as the problem size increases and can potentially take astronomical amounts of time to finish (thousands of years).  Most every-day problems have known solutions which run in polynomial and are much faster.  Furthermore, all problems in this group can be quickly converted into each other, so solving one of them quickly would allow you solve all of them quickly.
The P versus NP problem is an open problem in mathematics and computer science for which there is a $1,000,000 available for the first correct proof.  In relation to the previous point about NP completeness, the N = NP problem asks the question: "Does there exist any polynomial time algorithm for any NP-complete problem?".  If a polynomial time algorithm was discovered, it would have massive practical consequences for many areas of computer science.
The Halting Problem is an important theoretical problem in computer science that states that it is not possible to write a computer program that can analyse another computer program to tell if it will eventually stop running or not.  It is possible to write a program that can do this for other specific simple programs, but it is not possible to write a program that correctly determines if any program will halt.
Transactions represent work that must be done either completely or not at all.  The concept of transactions appears most often in databases, but it still applies to a number of other places in computer science.  The fundamental idea is that in a transaction you need to take extra care so that it is impossible to leave things in an intermediate state in the event of something like a power failure.
Finite-state Machines appear throughout computer science.
DFAs and NFAs are finite state-machines which are commonly used to model string parsing.  They are often used to model regular expressions.
Recursion is when a function calls itself.  The concept of recursion itself isn't all that complicated, but it is a frequent source of confusion for people who haven't worked with it a lot before.  One reason for the confusion is that people often have difficulty visualizing stack frames.
Compilers
Context-free Grammars are a fundamental tool used for describing what sequences of text can be used to construct a valid computer program.  In practice, you can create a 'grammar' for a new programming language then use this grammar to write a program that can execute (or do other things with) code from your newly invented programming language.
Extended Backus-Naur form is a commonly used representation for describing context-free grammars.
An LR Parser is a common type of parser that constructs a parse tree by starting at the bottom of the tree and moving up.
An LL Parser is a common type of parser that constructs a parse tree by starting at the top of the tree and moving down.
Lexing is often one of the first stages of compiling a computer program where parts of the program text are chunked together in a meaningful way.
Parsing is the phase of a compiling a computer program where some form of parse tree is created to represent the entire program.  Once this is done the syntax tree is handed off to later stages of the compiler.
A Deterministic Finite Automaton is a model that is closely related to state machines.  It is often used to describe what sequence of characters can appear in a given context (such as in a compiler's lexer).
Optimization is a vast topic in the field of compiler development that would take you a thousand lifetimes to explore everything there is to consider.
Linking is one of the steps involved in making a fully executable program where smaller chunks of compiled code are connected together in order to include all the pieces necessary for a fully functional final program.  It is particularly important in large applications that can have hundreds of components written by different people.
An Interpreter is a piece of software that is used to run programs without completely compiling them down to machine instructions for the host's target CPU first.  Interpreters can use varying degrees of emulation to achieve this, and they are often used with languages that are specifically intended to be 'interpreted'.  Many languages that are usually interpreted can also be compiled down to byte code in order to make they run faster.
GCC is one of the most popular C/C++ compilers for Unix based operating systems.
Clang is a newer compiler that is a major competitor to GCC with various pros and cons.
'LLVM' refers to a number of things, and is most often associated with the Clang compiler collection and related tools.
Operating Systems
The Kernel is the core part of an operating system that interacts directly with the hardware.  Its purpose it to provide higher-level tools to the rest of the operating system and user programs.  For example a kernel will often allow you to launch new processes and threads, request heap memory for a process, or allow a process to be blocked.
A Shell is the layer that goes over top of the operating system kernel (think of a nut with a shell around the kernel).  The shell provides a user-friends interface that allows the user to easily tell the kernel to do various things like launch processes, kill processes, write to disk, etc.
'The Stack' is a region of memory assigned to each thread of execution of a process that runs in an operating system.  It is a very fundamental concept that is found in virtually every operating system and a stack can even be used in small embedded programs that don't run inside the context of an operating system.  A program's stack stores temporary information and keeps track of what location to return to after a function call has completed (as well as other things).
'The Heap' is a region of memory that the operating system sets aside to give to programs when they require large contiguous memory regions of a given length.  The heap is different than the stack because the programmer must explicitly request for heap space to be allocated and freed, but this is not true of the stack.
The Scheduler is the part of the operating system that decides which program should run next.  A modern OS can have hundreds of programs running but only a few CPU cores to run them on.  The scheduler is responsible for efficiently solving the problem of choosing which thread to run next and where it should run.  The scheduler is part of the operating system kernel.
Context switching is one of the fundamental methods that an operating system running on a single CPU can use in order to run multiple programs one after another.  This can be done quickly enough to make it look like many programs are running at the same time from a user's perspective.
Virtual Memory is a level of indirection that allows the operating system to control what region of physical RAM actually gets accessed when a program access a particular memory 'address'.  Historically, programs would simply control physical address of byes in RAM, but this was not flexible or portable so virtual memory was invented.
A window manager is a common graphical software component that manages the layout of windows and controls how windows interact with other graphical elements on the screen.
Software Testing and Verification
Unit testing is a practice where software components are tested as individual 'units'.  Unit tests are often extremely quantitative are are likely to be run as automated tests.
Integration testing is the practice of bringing together individual software components and testing them after they have been 'integrated' together.  This catches bugs that wouldn't otherwise be expected, such as components that attempt to communicate with each other using the incorrect protocols, or unexpected environmental differences.
Test Driven Development is a style of software development that proposes that you should write tests for a feature before you write the feature itself.
Real-time Programming considers programming environments where the software must respond to real-world time-based constraints.  These real-time events could be simulated, for example in an animated movie rendering, or in the case of soft or hard real-time systems that respond to real-time events in the physical world.  Examples of hard real-time systems would be autopilots that control aircraft systems, or a pacemaker.  Hard real-time software is typically required to follow rigorous coding standards such as MISRA C due to their high cost of failure.
A Control Flow Graph is a representation of a computer program that shows all possible paths of execution in the form of a directed graph.  It is commonly used for static analysis, optimization, and in the creation of test cases.
Cyclomatic Complexity is a measure of how complicated a program's control flow graph is.
Static Analysis is the process of analysing code and looking for possible design problems before the program has been run.  The advantage here is that if you can find bugs with a given static analysis technique, you don't need to wait for the bug to occur in order to find it.
Dynamic Analysis is the process of analysing a running program to find error states.  This is often less desirable that finding the bugs using static analysis, but dynamic analysis can often find bugs that static analysis can't.  Dynamic analysis can also miss bugs if your program never gets sent the right inputs to make the bug appear.
Input Space Partitioning is a technique used in software testing to assign 'partitions' to the large input space of possible test cases for a given piece of software.  Based on the programmer's judgement, the partitions can be created so that there is at least one important test case in each partition.  This way, you can choose one test case from each partition instead of randomly choosing mostly repetitive test cases.
Software validation is the process of ensuring that a piece of software does what the customer wants it to.
Software verification is the process of ensuring that software meets its specification (regardless of whether that specification produces the product that the customer actually wants or not).
Software Engineering Interviews
Big O Notation (mentioned previously).
Algorithms and data structures are frequent topics of interview questions.
Design Patterns also come up frequently in interviews.
Interviewers will commonly ask you to write code on a whiteboard.
Fizz Buzz is a commonly asked programming filter question.  It is intended to be a very easy to pass programming test, so make sure you've read about it before.
Read Stories & Tips: 50+ Interviews With Facebook, Twitter, Amazon & Others for more information.
Software Development
JSON is an extremely popular format used to store data outside of computer programs.  It is often used when communicating data through a web-based request, but it is found in many other places.
XML is another popular method of storing data outside a computer program.  It can be compared and contrasted with JSON.
Git is an extremely popular version control tool.  It is used to keep backups of your source code, but also allows you to share and collaborate with teams of other software developers.  If you plan to write software for a living you should definitely learn Git because most companies use it already or are moving toward it.  Less popular alternatives to git are SVN, Perforce, or Team Foundation Server (and many others).
Floating Point Rounding Errors are an extremely common source of confusion among people who are not familiar with them.  Floating point numbers are also a common source of confusion for people who are very familiar with them.
Integer Division Rounding Errors are possibly surprising at first, but you'll get used to them.
Code Review is often done by companies to make sure their production code remains high-quality.
Pair Programming is a technique where two people will sit at one workstation with one person directing what should be done, and the other person doing it.  It is an effective way to mentor new programmers and spread knowledge about how to do tasks quickly.
Important Algorithms And Problems
Knapsack Problem
Travelling Salesman Problem
Dijkstra's Algorithm
Dynamic Programming
Merge Sort
Quicksort
Insertion Sort
Lamport Timestamps
Binary Search Tree, search, insert, and delete
Linked List, search, insert, and delete
Circular Buffer add and remove
Multi-processing And Synchronization
The Producer Consumer Problem is a commonly encountered problem where multiple threads of execution want to add or remove from a shared buffer.  This problem sounds simple, but it is actually extremely difficult and there are many variations on how to solve it under various different constraints.
A Semaphore is a tool used to solve various multi-programming problems.
A Mutex is another tool used to solve various multi-programming problems.
Semaphores and mutexes can be used to implement locks.
Amdahl's law is a formula that can be used to calculate the theoretical benefit from speeding up part of a task to take advantage of parallel processing.
Deadlocks are a common problem in a multi-programming environments.
Distributed Systems present a number of multi-programming challenges that can occur across large networks of computers.
Atomicity is an extremely important requirement for certain operations that must occur in a multi-programming environment.
Important Data Structures
A Stack is a data structure that you could visualize as a stack of dishes:  You can either put a new dish on top of the pile, or take one off of the top, but you can't remove or insert anything directly in the middle.
A Queue is a data structure that works just like a standard line people wait in at the grocery store:  People are served in the order in which they arrive.  It's no surprise that the British word for 'line up' is queue.
A List is guaranteed to remember ordering of elements, and also allows for duplicate elements.
A Set does not preserve ordering of elements, and does not allow for duplicate elements.
A Dequeue is similar to a queue, but elements can be added or removed from either end.
A Binary Search Tree is a tree based data structure where each item has a maximum of 2 children, and each child satisfies some property with respect to its parent.
A Heap is a tree based data structure where a given property is satisfied between every node and its children.
A Linked List is a method of implementing a list where each node in the list maintains a reference to the next node in the list.
A Directed Graph is a set of points (vertices) and lines (edges) connecting those points where each edge also has a direction associated with it.
An Undirected Graph just like a directed graph where there is no direction information associated with each edge.
A Map is a set of key and value pairs where each key can be used to look up its associated value.
A Hash Table is a data structure that used a hash function to take a variable length key, and map it to a fixed length number which can be used to locate or store something in a hash bucket.  A hash table can be used to implement a map.  Finally, hash tables are often the 'correct answer' to many job interview questions.
Software Design
UML is a standard for visually representing software components.
Software Design Pattern:  common solutions to common problems.
Interfaces are an extremely important (but abstract) topic in software engineering.  They allow us to formalize guarantees about what software will do, while ignoring irrelevant implementation details.
The concept of an Implementation is contrasted from that of an interface:  You should never rely on an implementation detail because it is considered to be part of the unpredictable working of the inside of a black box that will probably change in the future.
Defensive Programming involves being cautious of unforeseen errors or confusion when writing programs.
Object Oriented Programming is an extremely popular programming paradigm where data and functions are packaged together inside 'objects'.
Inheritance is a feature offered by many programming languages that allows classes to 'inherit' some aspects of other classes.
The Law of Demeter is a programming principle that encourages you to write code that maintains a clear separation of concerns.
Information Hiding is a programming principle that encourages hiding of implementation details where they cannot be accidentally exposed and depended upon by other parts of the software.
Web Software Development
A RESTful API is a commonly encountered method of implementing a web-based interface that accepts interactions from other computer programs.
DNS is the system that translates names like 'google.com' into an IP address which lower levels of the network stack can talk to.
If you become a web developer, Inspect Element will be one of your primary debugging tools.
SQL Injection is a common vulnerability (not limited to web applications) where the user is able to modify database queries in a way that the programmer did not expect.
Javascript is the primary client-side programming language for web applications.
XSS (Cross Site Scripting) is a type of web vulnerability where an attacker is able to inject Javascript onto a page and have this script run for other users.
If you pursue a career in web development, be mindful of the fact that there are Many Javascript Libraries and it is not uncommon for them to have backward-incompatible newer versions released or simply get abandoned.  Be careful about what you wasting your time learning.
Minification is commonly performed on Javascript or CSS files to reduce their file size.  This makes web pages load faster while their functionality remains the same.
A Web Server is a piece of software that responds to HTTP requests.  Whenever you browse to any web page, it is a web server that sends back the web page to you.
A Database Server is a piece of software that is responsible for storing and retrieving data quick and efficiently.  Databases often store data that isn't efficiently stored in regular files because of requirements to change the data often, or searching it faster than can be done in a regular file system.
Database Software
SQL is a standardized language for reading and writing from a database.  It is based on Relational Calculus and Relational Algebra.
The Entity-relationship Model is a method of representing relationships between things in a database.
NoSQL Databases are an alternative to SQL databases.  By avoiding many of the formalities that come with SQL databases, NoSQL databases can offer some performance advantages.  In some cases this is done at the cost of data integrity.
Isolation Levels describes the degree to which database queries can affect other queries that may be running concurrently.
Transactions are concerned with applying a collection of database queries either completely or not at all.  The outcome of a transaction will either be to commit or rollback.
ACID: (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) a set of important properties of database transactions.
Boyce–Codd normal form is one of several normal forms that are intended to reduce the amount of data duplication in a database.  Reducing data duplication saves disk space, and also reduces some common sources of mistakes.
Networking
The Internet protocol suite is a collection of internet communication protocols that you could spend a lifetime learning.
A ping test is a common test to measure the latency between two computers, or to identify if the remote computer is even able to respond.
The world is currently in the middle of a long-term migration away from the older IPV4 internet protocol to the newer IPV6 protocol.
DHCP is the protocol that (among other things) assigns your computer an IP when you connect to your home router.
HTTP is the protocol that web servers respond to as you browse to web pages. HTTPS is the secure version of this protocol that encrypts information sent between you and the web server.
SSH is a secure method you can use to connect to a remote machine over the internet.  You can use SSH tunneling to do various things like control a remote machine or set up and interact with remote services through a secure channel.
The 192.168.X.X IPV4 address space is reserved for private networks.  It is likely that your home router and home devices are given 192.168.X.X based addresses, so you will see '192.168' frequently.
localhost is a frequently used hostname that has been standardized to mean 'the current computer'.  It is usually mapped to the IPV4 address 127.0.0.1.  It is extremely useful for testing services locally before testing them over a network in order to isolate the source of problems.
Security
Symmetric-key Cryptography is the intuitive method of secure communication where you use the same secret key to encrypt messages and to decrypt them.
Public-key Cryptography is a secure communication scheme that involves two keys:  A private key, and a public key.  The public key is distributed 'publicly' can be used to encrypt messages, but not decrypt them, and the private key is kept 'private' and can encrypt or decrypt messages.
A Side-channel Attack is an attack on a cryptographic system that takes advantage of an unexpected 'side channel' of information leakage.  For example, you could analyse the sound of a computer processor to attempt to re-construct its internal state when encrypting some information.
A Buffer Overflow is an extremely common type of security vulnerability where a programmer accidentally writes code that can read past the end of a buffer.  This can almost always be exploited by users who have internal knowledge of the program stack and memory layout to cause the program to execute arbitrary code of their choosing.
A Port Scanner is a tool you can use to scan a host to check if there are services running on any open ports.  This can be done for legitimate reasons, but it can also be done by potentially malicious users looking for security vulnerabilities.
A brute force attack is an attempt to compromise a cryptographic system by simply trying every possible solution.  This type of attack works when someone uses weak passwords or poorly implemented cryptography, but in a well-designed cryptosystem it is usually impractical.

Interfaces - The Most Important Software Engineering Concept
2016-02-01 - By Robert Elder

Last Updated:  Sept 29, 2016

Synopsis

     An interface can be thought of as a contract between the system and the environment.  In a computer program, the 'system' is the function or module in question, and the 'environment' is the rest of the project.  The interface formally describes what can pass between the system and the environment.  An 'implementation' can be defined as the system minus the interface.  Interfaces in languages like Haskell can be extremely specific, or very non-specific like in Python.  The types of interfaces used can affect the amount of technical debt that is created (a mathematical formula is provided), and programmer productivity.  A method for quantifying and comparing interfaces is proposed.  Based on these comparisons, you can make a number of observations about the way a language or tool is used.

     Read the comment thread on Hacker News.

Overview

     The most important concept in software engineering is the concept of an interface.  This article is not about interfaces in Java, it is about interfaces in software design, and to a lesser extent, interfaces anywhere in the universe.  There are many other important concepts used in software development, but I would argue that many of them actually end up relating back to why interfaces are so important.  In this article, I will discuss:

What is an Interface?
An Interface as a Contract
What is a 'Module' or 'Abstraction'?
Abstraction Leaks
A Method for Comparing and Quantifying Interfaces
A proposal for how to treat interfaces with respect to patents and copyright.
Why people still use the command line.
Why it was the right move for Twitter to start with Ruby/Rails, then re-write their code in Scala.
Why Java and C++ are used so much in enterprise software.
An attempt at mathematically quantifying how technical debt scales, and why it only becomes obvious in large projects.
Why Python is so popular, specifically for newer programmers.
How to effectively cut corners, while minimizing technical debt.
What is an Interface?

     In university we learned of a couple succinct definitions for what an interface is that I really like:

An interface is a contract between the system and the environment.

     or alternatively

An interface is the intersection between the system and the environment.

Interface = System ∩ Environment

     The intersection definition fits well when the 'system' is actually a physical object.  The above definitions are very abstract, so let's go directly to a specific example of someone typing on a keyboard:

	

     In the above example, the system represents the laptop computer as a whole, the environment is the person's hands (and any nearby cats that like to step on keyboards).  The interface, therefore, must any part of the interaction between the hands and the computer that is not exclusively attributable to one or the other, but can only be attributed to both.  Normally we think of hands and keyboards as being distinctly separate, so the precise boundary of the interface in this case is up for philosophical debate.  It is up to the reader to decide whether they consider the entire keyboard, or just the individual atoms that come in contact with the fingers or keyboard to be part of the interface.  You might be wondering how this example can relate to the definition of an interface as a contract: The "contract" in this case is the convention that we all spent much effort learning back when we had to program our brains with all the muscle memory to know where all the keys are.  There are also more subtle aspects to the contract, like the fact that pressing a key and holding it down has a different meaning than pressing it quickly and releasing.

     This is a nice bit of philosophy, but what does it have to do with writing software?  Well, interfaces in programming are all around us, even if you're not aware of it.  If you're a Java programmer you explicitly name them for what they are, but they also exist in other languages like C.  Let's consider the interface of the function 'add_numbers' in the following example:

unsigned int add_numbers(unsigned int, unsigned int);

void other_function(void){
	add_numbers(3,4);
}

unsigned int add_numbers(unsigned int a, unsigned int b){
	return a + b;
}

int main(void){
	add_numbers(9,99);
	return 0;
}


     Let's apply the same highlighting technique to describe the environment, the 'add_numbers' system, and the interface:

	
	

     In the above illustrations, the 'system' in question consists of the 'add_numbers' function.  You would be correct to say that the main method, or the 'other_function' method could also be considered an individual system, however for simplicity the images above have considered the 'add_numbers' function as a system in isolation.  It would also be reasonable to consider the invocations of the 'add_numbers' function to be part of the interface too.  Note that we've added a fourth idea: an 'Implementation'.

Defining The System And The Environment

     I haven't yet defined the term 'system' or 'environment' yet, so let's review what I mean by these terms:  The system is easy to define:  It is whatever useful thing you're working with.  It could be your laptop computer, a computer program, the door to enter your house, or a small piece of source code.  What I mean by environment can be defined in terms of the system:  First, consider the environment to include the entire universe.  Now, take as much of the system as possible out of what you consider to be the environment, but stop once you've reached the point where removing anything further would prevent the environment from interacting with the system through its shared boundary to the system in question.  So if you consider the laptop example, we could still use the laptop if its internals were made differently (but had the same functionality), but once we start changing the keys around or the screen, then we would start having problems interacting with it.

Impossible Interfaces

     A worth-while question is:  "Is it possible to describe an interface that can't actually have an implementation?"  I would claim that you can, and that this would occur if your interface has contradictory claims in its description.  For example, if you defined an interface that asserted "This function does not return 0." and "This function returns 0.".  There is no possible implementation that is consistent with both of these assertions.  You are, however, free to make claims that you won't be able to deliver on when you describe the interface.

Defining The Implementation

 It is difficult to discuss interfaces without making reference to implementations, so let's go ahead and try to formally define what an implementation is:

An implementation is the system minus the interface:

Implementation = System ∖ Interface Implementation = System ∖ (System ∩ Environment)

     Please note that I've never actually heard of (or don't remember) anyone else defining an implementation this way, but it seems like such an irresistible extension of the set based definition of an interface and it has a couple other benefits I'll discuss shortly.  If you're a poor student studying for an exam, your professor will probably have never heard of this definition.  I also wouldn't be surprised if this definition was in conflict with some Object Oriented Programming taxonomy, but even it does, I don't plan to change it.  Let those crazy OOP people change their textbooks to match my definition.

     Defining implementations this way leads us to other reasonable conclusions: When we talk about interfaces on physical systems, we typically think of the 'system implementation' as the entire physical object, and it would be unnatural to consider the 'real' system implementation to exclude the buttons, screens or any other physical part.  This pushes us to consider the interface to include as little as possible of the physical system, and represent more of a convention.  It is almost as if an interface were just a set of promises, guarantees, or some kind of ... CONTRACT BETWEEN THE SYSTEM AND THE ENVIRONMENT!

An Interface as a Contract

     Let's consider the interface to the function 'add_numbers' in the previous example as a contract, and see what it guarantees:

'add_numbers' is a function that exists.
'add_numbers' takes exactly two parameters, both of which are 'unsigned int's.
'add_numbers' returns exactly one 'unsigned int'.

     The interface for this function does not say anything about

Whether 'add_numbers' will ever halt.
The asymptotic run-time complexity of 'add_numbers'.
The quantity of free memory required to run 'add_numbers'.
What the implementation of 'unsigned int' really is.
Side effects (like allocating memory, and modifying global variables)

     The interface to 'add_numbers' described above is known as a function 'prototype', and in earlier versions of K&R C, there was a weaker form of describing interfaces:

unsigned int add_numbers();


     Defining an interface as a "contract" is very convenient for programming since most programming tasks simply amount to defining and requiring sets of axioms. Post-conditions, and pre-conditions are all guarantees about certain properties or behaviour.  Before two parties engage in doing business together, they ought to have a contract prepared.  The contract spells out what the deliverables are, how much money is paid, and when.  Other topics like early termination, indemnification, expenses are all lain out in advance.  When the contract is breached, a court or an arbitrator can resolve the situation, but if you forget to define something in the contract, then unexpected surprises are more likely.  In a computer program we have the same thing: Modules and functions specify what they want, and (sometimes) what they will return.  A breach of this contract will result in a compile error, a run-time error, program fault, build system or linter failure or even your manager yelling at you.  I would go so far as to say that the concept of defining an interface as a "contract" is not even metaphorical.  It really is the same concept as a business contract, even thought a business contract is typically not as detailed.

Patents, Copyright and Interfaces

     This section does not consist of legal advice and may even be in contradiction with existing law, all statements herein are the opinions of the author.

     In the previous section, I stated that I would consider an interface to literally be a 'business contract' between two entities, and I emphasized that I don't consider this to be a metaphor.  I believe this interpretation is one that appeals to the concerns of both computer scientists and also to legal professionals who aim to protect creative works.

     Should an interface be patentable?  Using the definition included in this article, that an interface is a contract between the system and the environment, I do not believe that interfaces should be patentable, and so far the existing case law seems to agree with me.  Keep in mind, however, that the word 'interface' is very generic, and is often used in a way that is different than how I have defined it in this article.  

     Should an interface be copyrightable?  Using the definition included in this article, that an interface is a contract between the system and the environment, I do believe that the "Source Code" of an interface should be copyrightable.  Furthermore, the copyrightable aspects of an interface should extend no further than the point just before they begin to cover the aspects of an interface that make interfaces so special.   The copyright should cover only the medium (source code or handwritten copy), but not the guarantees or constraints.  If any guarantees or constraints of the interface become inseparable from any part of the medium, then those parts of the medium should be disqualified from copyrightability.  I'll propose a simple test that could be applied to determine if something is not copyrightable:

If you consider a set of attributes of an interface that you'd like to consider copyrightable, given any conceivable third-party piece of software that successfully uses the interface in question in any way, it should always be possible to build some drop-in replacement that declares and implements the same interface and is successfully used by the third-party software without any modification to the third-party software, and without infringing any copyrights.  If every possible drop-in replacement would cause infringement or require that the third-party software be modified or regress in functionality, then the chosen set of copyrightable attributes are too aggressive must be reduced.

     I believe the above test would be appropriate to test for patentability as well.  Note that this test would only determine if something is not copyrightable or patentable.  It would say nothing about conclusively determining whether it is copyrightable or patentable.  Finally, the above test is just my opinion, don't confuse it with actual law.

     An important thing to point out in relation to the above test, is that any criteria that could be considered part of the interface in one language, may not be part of the interface in another language.  For example, in Java the order in which functions are declared does not affect program execution.  If you were tempted to casually say 'the order of functions in the file never matters', then you would be incorrect if you consider the following python program:

def foo():
        print("asdf")

def foo(abc):
        print(abc)

foo("lol")


     Giving consideration to the legal aspects of interfaces prompted me to go back and take a look at the famous Oracle Vs. Google case.  The provided link includes details of the case that would be interesting to software developers, so that's what I'll draw on for my analysis.  In summary, based on what I see, I can't find a reason to disagree with the outcome in favour of Oracle.  That's not to say that I support it, since the publicly available case details that I can find are fairly sparse.

     I think the concern among most software developers was that the outcome of the case might set a precedent that would allow copyright or patents to cover parts of interfaces that would cause the above test I proposed to fail.

     The outcome of the case rested on the district court's finding that 'the "structure, sequence and organization" of an API was copyrightable.'  As I mentioned above, I don't think there is a problem with this, as long as the definition of "structure, sequence and organization" does not cause the above test to fail.  Here are a few quotes from the linked article that are key:

     "The district court concluded that 'there is only one way to write' the declarations to interface with Java. If true, the use of identical declarations would not be copyrightable. However, except for three of the API packages, Google did not dispute the fact that it could have written its own API packages to access the Java language." and finally "Google conceded that it copied the declarations verbatim."

     It would seem that the district court made the right decision in concluding that the intrinsically unique properties of an interface are not copyrightable, but Google also admitted to copying declarations 'verbatim'.  If 'verbatim' can be take to include literal copy and pasting, that includes non-functional aspects like white space, and spelling mistakes in comments, then I think it would be very reasonable to consider this as copyright infringement.  The non-copyrightability of an interface does not need to prevent an individual artistic expression of an interface from being copyrighted.

     My knowledge of this case only comes from what I can read online, but it would appear to me that Google created verbatim copies of Java source code which happened to include interfaces.  Google themselves appears to have been been of the opinion that their use of Java required licensing, because prior to 2010 Google pursued licensing deals with Sun to license the use of Java.  After Sun was acquired by Oracle, the licensing negotiations fell through.  The fact that Google was pursuing licensing deals that didn't come to fruition, but continued using 'verbatim' copies of code doesn't seem to help their case.  I suspect that Google's lawyers may have known they had a weak case, and so they attempted to use a defense related to the very legitimate claim that interfaces should not be copyrighted, and hoped that the source code representation of an interface, and the more philosophical concept would become conflated, allowing them to win the case.

What is a 'Module' or 'Abstraction'?

     When I think about a 'Module' this is what I picture in my mind:

     The reason I think this representation applies so well is because it clearly emphasizes the importance of the boundary of the module, and how it interfaces with the rest of its environment.  Furthermore, the interface of the cube above imposes very strong constraints about how the external world can interact with what is inside.  You can't go around the interface, so if you want to interact with it, you must do so through the means it exposes to you.  Finally, there is nothing in the cube, but we actually don't care, because it's not what's on the inside that counts (sorry cube), it's the interface that is exposed to the world.

     Another example I really like is that of a cell and its membrane:  Features on the cell surface like transport and receptor proteins only permit certain things in the extra-cellular matrix to influence what happens inside the cytoplasm according to very specific rules:

     In the context of this article, I will refer to 'modules' and 'abstractions' as if they were the same concept.  The dictionary definition of these words is certainly not the same, and even between programming languages these concepts have different meanings.  The key properties I'm interested in are that both of them can be though of as a 'system' as we've been using the term in this article: Abstractions and modules can be thought of as something consisting of an interface, and an implementation.  You could think of an individual function in C as a module, a 'module' in Python, a class or package in Java.  Anything that has some kind of externally presented interface, and some 'hidden' implementation.  Note that the 'hiddenness' of the implementation can be imposed by the rules of the language, or even just by convention of the programmer.

Abstraction Leaks

     As far as I can tell, the idea of an abstraction leak can be traced back to an essay by Joel Spolsky.  There are a few good examples of specific abstraction leaks in the essay, but I'd like to add one of my own: The concept of a 'map' is very common in programming, and represents a data structure consisting of key and value pairs.  An important constraint that the map guarantees is that all map keys must be unique: Trying to write a new value to a given key either results in an error, or overwriting the previous value for that key.  The result is never to have duplicate keys.  An extremely common programer requirement is to want to iterate over all the keys of the map.  Since ordering of keys is not necessarily a guarantee maps provide, you might wonder what order the keys will be in when you iterate over them?  Well, the ordering is not defined, because the map interface does not provide any guarantee of ordering.  Therefore, any ordering is considered acceptable, but in practice the keys are likely to be sorted in some way.  Why would they be sorted?  Well, sorting happens to be an efficient way of organizing the data.  It can make things like checking for pre-existing keys easier.

     Iterating over sorted data can produce very different results than iterating over random data.  For example, if you're trying to find the minimum number in a list:

min = null;
list = map.getMapKeys();
for (item in list){
	if ( min == null ){
		min = item
	}else if (item < min){
		min = min;   /*  This line has a bug */
	}
}


     The 'else if' branch will never execute if your data is sorted in ascending order, and even if you do randomised input testing, your program will never uncover the problem with this line.  This is a huge problem, because if you swap the map implementation out for another one that doesn't return sorted keys, then your code is suddenly going to start running the buggy code path.  At this point, you've complete forgotten about this code, and it is hidden inside a huge monolithic project.

     I'm going to propose my own definition of an abstraction leak for use later in this article:

An abstraction leak exists when it is possible for an implementation to affect the environment in a way that was not agreed upon in the interface.

     Using this definition, it would seem that nearly every abstraction is leaky, because specifying every environmental effect in the interface is only practical in the most rigorous mathematical systems.  For physical systems, you could probably also make a connection to Gödel's incompleteness theorems here.  The idea that most abstractions are leaky is not unfounded since that is essentially what Joel Spolsky implies with his 'The Law of Leaky Abstractions':

"All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky."

     Well if every abstraction is leaky why bother talking about it?  Problems only occur when a part of the environment begins to rely on one of these unspecified environmental effects that originated from the system in question.  These are the problematic abstraction leaks that everybody talks about.

     This has far-reaching consequences, not only for casual bugs but also in the security domain.  There is one well-known phrase related to the security of physical systems, where unintended effects from the system leak into the environment in a way that compromises its security: A Side-channel attack.  Combining this with the claim that all abstractions are leaky would give the following conclusion:

Every physical implementation of a cryptosystem is vulnerable to a side-channel attack.

     Given what we've discussed above, it is not unreasonable to extend this idea to include not only physical implementations, but also emulated ones as well.

Quantifying and Comparing Interfaces

     As we saw above, interfaces in C specify things like the return type, and the number of parameters that can be passed into a function.  But what do interfaces in Python specify?  Note that I'm using the term 'interface' in a way that is consistent with this article, which is likely more general than any literature you've read before on 'interfaces' in Python.

def add_numbers(a,b):
        return a + b


print(add_numbers(3,1))
print(add_numbers("abc","def"))


     In Python you don't have to specify the types on the interface to a function.  This has the benefit of making the function easier to define and invoke because there is less information to specify, and the disadvantage of less constraints that can be checked ahead of time (to detect possible programming errors).

     I think there is something to be said about comparing and quantifying the different characteristics of an interface in terms of how many ways you can send information through them.  This could be done for a specific interface, but also from the perspective of all interfaces that can be specified in a given programming language.  It may also be useful for comparing the safety of specific interfaces within the same language.  For the 'add_numbers' example in C, let's consider how much information we can send both through, and around the interface through abstraction leaks:

Information Through C Interface
Characteristic Description
	
Number of Possible States

Parameter 1 Type	1 (unsigned int)
Parameter 2 Type	1 (unsigned int)
Return Value Type	1 (unsigned int)
Parameter 1 Value	2^(# bits in 'unsigned int')
Parameter 2 Value	2^(# bits in 'unsigned int')
Return Value	2^(# bits in 'unsigned int')
	
Information Around C Interface
Characteristic Description
	
Number of Possible States

Global Variable States	(# global variables) * (# global variable states)
Filesystem	# filesystem states
CPU Time Taken	Unbounded
Heap State	# heap states
Many Others...	...

     And these are the number of things that can be communicated through the python interface to 'add_numbers'

Information Through Python Interface
Characteristic Description
	
Number of Possible States

Parameter 1 Type	practically infinite
Parameter 2 Type	practically infinite
Return Value Type	practically infinite
Parameter 1 Value	practically infinite
Parameter 2 Value	practically infinite
Return Value	practically infinite
	
Information Around Python Interface
Characteristic Description
	
Number of Possible States

Global Variable States	(# global variables) * (# global variable states)
Filesystem	# filesystem states
CPU Time Taken	Unbounded
Heap State	# heap states
Many Others...	...

     Now if you take a look at the types of interfaces we can describe in Haskell (Thanks to James Hudon for reviewing this, since I barely know any Haskell):

add_numbers :: Int > Int -> Int
add_numbers 3 4 = 7

main = print (add_numbers 3 4)


     With the above Haskell code, the interface 'add_numbers' can accept the following information:

Information Through Haskell Interface
Characteristic Description
	
Number of Possible States

Parameter 1 Type	1 (Int)
Parameter 2 Type	1 (Int)
Return Value Type	1 (Int)
Parameter 1 Value	1 (the value 3)
Parameter 2 Value	1 (the value 4)
Return Value	at least 2^30[1]
	
Information Around Haskell Interface
Characteristic Description
	
Number of Possible States

CPU Time Taken	Unbounded
CPU/Memory Cache effects	Unbounded
Possibly Others...	...

     For a specific interface in a given language, you can quantify a couple different things:

The number of unique ways you can communicate information through the interface
The number of unique ways you can communicate information around the interface through abstraction leaks

     From the perspective of programming languages you can also make observations about

How restrictive the language lets you be about how much or how little information goes through an interface
What tools the language provides you with for preventing communication around the interface.

     If you extend the same type of analysis to other interfaces, like for example graphical user interface where you can change directories:

Information Through GUI
Characteristic Description
	
Number of Possible States

Click On Folder 1	# of pixels Folder 1 takes on screen * number of clicks
Click On Folder 2	# of pixels Folder 2 takes on screen * number of clicks
Hover On Folder 1	# of pixels Folder 1 takes on screen
Hover On Folder 2	# of pixels Folder 2 takes on screen
Time between hover/click events	Infinite
Common Keyboard events	# common key combinations
GUI Screen Area	# Pixels used for GUI display
	
Information Around GUI
Characteristic Description
	
Number of Possible States

Hidden UI features	Unlimited
Non-standard keyboard shortcuts	# of pixels Button 2 takes on screen
Other unexpected UI features	...

     And if you review the same task of changing directories performed on the command line using 'cd':

Information Through GUI
Characteristic Description
	
Number of Possible States

Number of possible directories typed	Unlimited
	
Information Around GUI
Characteristic Description
	
Number of Possible States

Environment Variables	Unlimited

     For the information sent through GUIs and the command line, there is actually another piece of data that I didn't include in the above tables:  The amount of noise in the signal.  If you consider how hard it is to exactly repeat a sequence of keyboard strokes (key by key) versus a sequence of mouse movements (pixel by pixel), you'll note that there is always way more error in the data you get from a mouse movement or click versus a keyboard stroke.  GUIs compensate for this by making the semantics they accept more non-specific.  Can you imagine if the clickable area on "OK" and "Cancel" buttons was only 1 pixel wide?  In addition, this analysis can get even more complex when you consider how the error rates change for differently abled individuals.

     Now that I've reviewed one possible way to quantifying and comparing interfaces, I'll make a few extrapolations from these examples and my own personal experience:

Human beings tend to prefer interfaces that aren't very specific about the information they accept, especially when they are unfamiliar with that interface
Interfaces that aren't very specific about what information they accept are prone to being misused.
Catch-all interfaces that accept large amounts of information are seen as powerful, but are often misused.
Humans tend to communicate information around an interface when communication becomes tedious.
Communicating around an interface through abstraction leaks is very prone to undesirable surprises.
Leaky and Specific Interfaces

     I'm going to make a lot of observations based on the analysis in the previous section, so I'll define a couple terms for the sake of clarity:

A Leaky interface exists when the interface is prone to being ignored during any communication between the system and the environment.

An interface is Specific if is has a relatively small number of possible inputs and outputs.

     For more details on Leaky interfaces, consult the section on abstraction leaks.  A good example of what I mean by a Specific interface would be piecewise defined functions, defined only for a very small number of inputs.

     If you can meaningfully quantify how 'leaky', or 'specific' interfaces are, I think it is worth defining a spectrum where interfaces that are very specific and non-leaky are on one end, and non-specific and leaky interfaces are on the other:

     There are probably reasonable arguments to move any of the items in the spectrum above either more to the right, or the left, but you get the idea.  Note that you could probably split this up into two spectrums:  One for how much the interfaces allow for 'leaky' abstractions, and one for how specific the interfaces are, although in general these two concepts seem to be correlated.  Another correlation that I would propose based on my experience is that 'errors' that come from tools on the "Non User Friendly" end of this spectrum are less frequent, and when they do happen, they are more likely to be caused by failures in validation.  For the "User Friendly" end of the spectrum, errors are more frequent, and more likely to be verification errors.

The Asymptotic Complexity of Technical Debt

     I'm going to start this section with a claim:

The majority of technical debt in a project originates from an inappropriate reliance on abstraction leaks, or a reliance on extremely non-specific interface contracts that have difficult to foresee consequences.

     When a project starts there are only one or two modules, and the amount of work you need to do to specify a good interface contract is O(1). If you design a bad interface, the amount of technical debt you will create is O(1) too, so there is not much payoff to taking the time to get the interface contract right.  But as the number of modules increases linearly, the worst-case number of inter-module communications increases according to O(N^2).  Therefore, if you make bad interface contracts, the worse case number of invocations to these bad interface contracts will scale according to N^2 (if every module talks to every other module.).

     In the above graph, you can see that it is initially less work to avoid creating well-defined interfaces, however, this advantage is quickly overtaken because of the fact that inter-module communication problems will occur at a rate that is polynomial in the number of modules, whereas the work required to create good interface specifications is linear in the number of modules.  The polynomial cost comes from considering the handshake problem where in a worst case, every module communicates with every other module.  Obviously, the average project will have communication requirements that scale at a rate of less than O(n^2), but it will definitely be more than O(n).  There is also another factor that deceivingly shifts the rapid increase off into the future:  The human memory.  When you first start out, even if you have 20 modules, you can probably keep in your head what all of them do, so vague function names and esoteric conventions are all the contracts that you need.  Once the project gets large enough that you forget these, or you bring in someone else, the polynomial cost always dominates.

Why do People Still Use the Command Line?

     When you ask this question, people generally give a few different answers, none of which are what I consider to be the most important:

It is very powerful and flexible.
The command line uses less resources.
Using the command line gives you more understanding about how things work under the hood.

     The most important reason why we still use the command line is AUTOMATION!  It is difficult to overestimate the productivity gain you get by automating tasks.  If I need to launch a cluster of 100 servers, are you going to log into each server and manually install your software stack by clicking on a bunch of GUIs?  Even if you want to automate the task of clicking on the GUIs, you'd need some kind of file storage that remembers how and where to click on things.  Some sort of file full of flexible... commands.

     Another general relationship I'll make with the section on quantifying and comparing interfaces, is that even though we could automate things through automated clicks and screen grabbers, this type of communication is designed for humans, and thus it exposes a very non-specific interface that does not allow you to be very precise.  The result is that your automatic clicker is very likely to get stuck on a screen because a window moved when it didn't expect it to, or perhaps a colour or font changed.  There are too many variables with a GUI.  With the command line, everything is much more precise, and you communicate everything through a very narrow unforgiving interface, which is why many humans don't like it but other computer programs do.

     There are of course, situations where the imprecise communication of a GUI is a virtue.  For example, when doing graphic art work you generally don't care about specifying every individual pixel shade and colour, but you do want something to be specified for every pixel.  In this situation the noise from any motions of your hand as you move the cursor actually become meaningful informational content for the final product.

Choosing the Right Language

     If you read the section on the asymptotic complexity of technical debt you might come away with the impression that you should always start a project in a language with very specific interface contracts, like Haskell or Java.  That is not at all the message I want to convey.  If you're making a decision about what language to use for a particular project, I think this question is likely to help:

How likely is it that the requirements for the project will change?

     If you're starting a business, the answer is almost certainly going to be 'very likely', especially if you're building a small product from scratch and you're still establishing product market fit.  If you already know exactly what the requirements are, for example, if you're building a compiler, or something based on an international standard, then you'd probably answer 'not very likely'.

     If you answered 'very likely' to this question, then you would probably want to go with a language that doesn't cause you to waste a lot of time specifying interface contracts, because they will likely work against you when the requirements change.  After all, the goal at this stage isn't to get the perfect implementation of the requirements, it is to get the perfect requirements so you can start the final implementation.  An exception to this would be if your MVP actually consists of a huge system that is likely to have hundreds of modules.  If there are already many people involved in building the software then good interface contracts will be necessary to prevent them from stepping on each others toes.

     If you answered 'not very likely' to this question, then you should probably start off with a language that has very strong interface contracts.  It will be more work to get started, but it will also be less work to add new features on day number 1523.  The only exception, would be if you're writing something small (say a few hundred lines).

     Back in the day there was much discussion about how Twitter started out using Ruby on Rails, and then later encountered a number of scaling issues because of this.  They later switched to using Scala.  Some would probably claim that this represented a failure, and that the right decision was to pick Scala all along.  I don't believe this is true.  The idea of Twitter itself is extremely simple, so with a number of potential competitors their initial primary goal was to gain enough market share to be dominant.  They needed to grow as fast as possible at all costs.  This meant iterating on features as fast as possible to figure out what product people actually want them to build.  The scaling issues are not a symptom of failure, but a symptom of success.  The vision for what the 'product' of Twitter actually was articulated, all that was left was to build it.  From the perspective of developers, this is a nirvana like situation that every programmer dreams about, but never experiences:  When your boss says "Re-write this crappy code from scratch in your favourite language in whatever way you want so that it is easier to work on later."  Re-writing something from scratch when you have a weaker reference implementation is not as much work as figuring out what product you actually need build to start a rocket ship company.  Unfortunately, most companies only see this type of switch as an unnecessary cost meant to scratch a programmer's obsessive itch, and waste a lot of time trying to scale something that just wasn't meant to scale.

Why is Python So Popular?

     In the section on leaky and specific interfaces, I discussed how you can classify interfaces according to how prone they are to abstraction leaks, and how specific the interface definitions can be.  I also pointed out the fact that languages that are considered more 'user friendly' and 'productive' are often the ones that on the highly leaky, and non-specific end of this spectrum.




     I claim that the reason Python is so popular is because it is an excellent introductory language due to its extremely lean interface contracts.  This is also the same reason that Python becomes difficult to maintain as the size of a project increases.

     Python is also very popular in the scientific community, and for people experimenting with numerical computation.  The very nature of experimentation requires that you constantly iterate on the design of what you're building, and for this reason more specific interfaces would slow down the experimentation process.

Why is Enterprise Software Usually Java/C++?

     I claim that the reason is exactly the opposite reason as in the previous section on 'Why Python is So Popular?'.  In the section on leaky and specific interfaces, I discussed the tradeoffs related to different types of interfaces.  Interfaces in Java and C++ fall more on the specific end of the spectrum than those found in other languages like Python or Ruby.  C++ and Java still can be leaky, and of course there are even more specific languages like Haskell, but Java and C++ seem to strike a balance between scalabilty, user friendliness, and iteration time.  These languages also provide the programmer with flexibility in how leaky they would like their interfaces to be as a matter of project convention.  An example would be how you can make variables or functions private, public, or protected, depending depending on the needs of the project.

How to Cut Corners Efficiently

     If there is one thing you should take away from this article, it is this: If you have to cut corners in your project, do it inside the implementation, and wrap a very good interface around it.  You might be thinking that if the implementation is bad enough, then the problems in that implementation can leak to other parts of your system, but they shouldn't!  If they do, I would call that bad interface design!  For the sake of clarity, I'll explicitly list out what I mean my 'interfaces' here:

Function Protoypes
Java 'Interfaces'
Public Class Methods
Public Member Variables
Header (.h) files in C/C++.
RESTful API endpoints
URL Routing
Publicly visible aspects of 'Modules' or 'Packages'
Database Schema (DDL)
Many Others...
Conclusion

     As you can see, the concept of an 'interface' is an incredibly important one with a variety of far reaching consequences.  There are legal consequences, productivity consequences, and a number of very philosophical connections you can make to other aspects of system design.  Ask any experienced programmer what they think about interfaces and you're likely to get an earful.

Scala Variances: Covariance, Contravariance, and Invariance

Mansi Babbar

Just now·5 min read

1. Variance

Variance is the interconnection of subtyping relationship between complex types and their component types.

Variance is all about sub-typing. It tells us if a type constructor is a subtype of another type constructor. Variance defines inheritance relationships of parameterized types(types that have parameters within them).

Sub-Typing

Every programming language supports the concept of types. Types give information about how to handle values at runtime. Subtyping adds more constraints to the values of a type.

Let’s see an example of subtyping:

sealed trait Polygon
case object Parallelogram extends Polygon
case object Rectangle extends Parallelogram
case object Square extends Rectangle

The type Square is a subtype of Rectangle, which is a subtype of Parallelogram, which is a subtype of trait Polygon.

Type Constructor and Parametrized Types

Scala supports generic types or type constructors to reuse code for many types at once. Type constructors are a mechanism that provides type variables that we can bind to concrete types.

Image from here

Here T is known as Type Parameter and List[T] is known as Generic or Type Constructor.

For List[T], if we use List[Int], List[AnyVal], etc. then these List[Int] and List[AnyVal] are known as Parameterized Types.

2. Types of Variance

Scala supports three types of variance:

Covariance (Preserved)
Contravariance (Reversed)
Invariance (Ignored)

Scala supports variance annotations of type parameters of generic classes, to allow them to be covariant, contravariant, or invariant(if no annotations are used).

2.1. Covariance
Image from here

If S is subtype of T then List[S] is a subtype of List[T].

This kind of inheritance relationship between two parameterized types is known as Covariance.

We declare a covariant type constructor using the following notation:

Image from here

A type parameter T of a generic class can be made covariant by using the annotation +T.

Let’s see an example of a covariant type constructor:

class Shape[+T](polygon: T)
sealed trait Polygon
case object Parallelogram extends Polygon

We defined the type constructor Shape as covariant, which means that the type Shape[Parallelogram] is a subtype of Shape[Polygon]. The covariance property allows us to declare a variable like:

val shape: Shape[Polygon] = new Shape[Parallelogram](List(new Parallelogram))

Every time we need to assign a variable of type Shape[T], we can use an object of type Shape[R], given that R is a subtype of T.

Covariance is type-safe because it reflects the standard behavior of subtyping. Assigning an object to a variable of one of its super-types is always safe.

In the above example, if we remove the covariant annotation from the type constructor Shape[T], the compiler warns us that we cannot use an object of type Parallelogram.

2.2. Contravariance
Image from here

If S is subtype of T then List[T] is a subtype of List[S].

This relation is contrary to the covariance relation.

This kind of inheritance relationship between two parameterized types is known as Contravariance.

We declare a contravariant type constructor using the following notation:

Image from here

A type parameter T of a generic class can be made contravariant by using the annotation -T.

Let’s see an example of a contravariant type constructor:

class Shape[+T](polygon: T)
case object Rectangle
case object Square extends Rectangle

We defined the type constructor Shape as contravariant, which means that the type Shape[Rectangle] is a subtype of Shape[Square]. The contravariance property allows us to declare a variable like:

val shape: Shape[Square] = new Shape[Rectangle](List(new Rectangle))

Every time we need to assign a variable of type Shape[T], we can use an object of type Shape[R], given that T is a subtype of R.

2.3. Invariance

If S is subtype of T then List[S] and List[T] don’t have inheritance relationship or sub-typing. That means both are unrelated.

Generic classes in Scala are invariant by default. This means that they are neither covariant nor contravariant.

We say that a type constructor F[_] is invariant if any subtype relationship between types A and B is not preserved in any order between types F[A] and F[B].

This kind of relationship between two parameterized types is known as Invariance or Non-Variance.

Let’s see an example of an invariant type constructor:

class Shape[T](polygon: T)
case object Parallelogram
case object Rectangle extends Parallelogram

The Shape[Parallelogram] accepts only Parallelogram type. Any super type or sub type is not accepted.

val suite: Shape[Parallelogram] = new Shape[Parallelogram](List(new Parallelogram))
3. Variance and Liskov Substitution Principle

Variance is related to the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) telling that “functions that use pointers to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it”.

This means that if S is a subtype of T, then the objects of type T maybe replaced with objects of type S without changing the behavior of T.

4. Conclusion

We looked at the three types of variance: covariance, contravariance, and invariance.

Information Regarding the Cyber-Attack on Spread Group
Published 12. Jul 2021 in Company

Spread Group was the target of an organized cyber-attack which was carried out with considerably vicious criminal intent. The unidentified perpetrators managed to break through the company’s high security standards and access internal data, including the addresses and contractual data of customers, partners, employees, and external suppliers.

Also affected are the payment details of a small number of customers who made payments to Spreadshirt, Spreadshop or TeamShirts via bank transfer, or who have received a refund via bank transfer. According to the latest information from our investigations, the bank details of any other customers were not saved on any of the hacked servers.

In addition, the bank account numbers and PayPal addresses of partners who have received commission payments from Spread Group were also affected.

Spread Group has proactively contacted everyone who has been affected informing them of the incident. We highly recommend those affected to change the passwords of their accounts with us.

The company’s crisis team is working with external cyber-security specialists to systematically investigate these events. We have also informed the relevant authorities about this incident.

Our day-to-day operations have not been impacted by this incident. All our systems are up and running as normal. Spread Group is fully able to produce and deliver orders.

We will keep this post updated as well as a dedicated help page as soon as more information is available.
